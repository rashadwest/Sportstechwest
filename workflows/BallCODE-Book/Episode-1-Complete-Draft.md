## Alignment Check

### On-Court Objective: Clean transition into half-court without a turnover
✅ **Aligned:** Act III shows controlled outlet → fill lanes → safe entry to set, maintaining state through three linked actions without turnover.

### Coding Concept: State (start/live/dead/outcome)
✅ **Aligned:** 
- Story introduces all four states clearly
- Skill Pit-Stop explains each state with examples
- Exercises practice identifying and tracking states
- State transitions are shown throughout the story

### Math Concept: Possession count, turnovers (basic stats)
✅ **Aligned:**
- Act II includes explicit counting: "Three possessions, two turnovers, zero points"
- Turnover rate is discussed as a problem to solve
- Basic statistics are woven into the narrative

### AI Mechanic: Vision cue detects state shifts; player confirms
✅ **Aligned:**
- Arc (AI assistant) detects state shifts: "State shift detected"
- Player confirmation required: "Is the current state correct?" / "Yes, state is DEAD. Confirmed."
- Confidence scores provided: "Confidence: 95%"
- Human-AI collaboration shown throughout

### Climax Challenge: Maintain correct state across 3 linked actions
✅ **Aligned:**
- Act III explicitly shows three actions:
  1. Controlled outlet
  2. Fill the lanes
  3. Safe entry to set
- State is maintained (LIVE) through all three actions
- Challenge is successfully completed

### Age-Appropriate Language (Grades 3-8)
✅ **Aligned:**
- Simple, clear language
- Technical terms explained
- Engaging, adventurous tone
- No overly complex concepts

### Character Consistency
✅ **Aligned:**
- Nova: Fast processor, sees court like code, leadership
- Atlas: Strength and balance, precise movements
- Pixel: Sharpshooter, pattern-spotter, comic relief
- Anchor: Gentle giant, protects paint
- Coach Circuit: Mentor, translates basketball to code
- Arc: AI assistant with confidence scores and explanations

## Next Steps

1. Self-edit story for clarity and flow
2. Polish Skill Pit-Stop language
3. Test exercises with target age group
4. Create visual assets (using briefs)
5. Integrate with Unity game system
6. Create production-ready PDFs

## Notes

- Story successfully introduces world, characters, and core concept
- State concept is clearly explained and demonstrated
- Exercises provide hands-on practice
- All learning objectives are met
- Ready for beta testing once visuals and game integration are complete
