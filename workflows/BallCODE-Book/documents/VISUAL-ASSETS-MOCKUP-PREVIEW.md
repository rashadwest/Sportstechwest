## 🎮 USING GAME ASSETS INSTEAD?

**You mentioned: "It seems like it should be from the game"**

**Great idea!** If you have game screenshots or assets, we can use those instead!

### **Option 1: Game Screenshots** (If Available)
- **Court Map:** Screenshot of the game court
- **Shadow Press Scouts:** Screenshot of the opposing team/characters
- **State Diagram:** Screenshot of the game showing states, OR create diagram from game visuals

### **Option 2: Game Assets** (If Available)
- Extract sprites/characters from Unity game
- Use game backgrounds/court visuals
- Create diagrams using game art style

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Use game screenshots for Court Map and Characters
- Create custom State Diagram (educational diagram)

## 🔍 WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

**Questions:**
1. Do you have screenshots from the Unity game?
2. Do you have game assets (sprites, backgrounds) we can use?
3. Would you prefer game screenshots over generated illustrations?
4. Where are game visuals stored? (Unity project, screenshots folder, etc.)

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

**If you have game assets:**
1. Find game screenshots/assets
2. Use them instead of generating new ones
3. Much faster! (5-10 minutes vs 35-45 minutes)

**If you don't have game assets:**
1. Generate illustrations in Glif (35-45 minutes)
2. Style them to match your game aesthetic
3. Use them as previews/educational support
