intro: "<p>My name is Rashad West and I am creating a data science project to create an algo and model for player performance.  Currently I am working on using data to challenge the assumption of the best point guard shooter of all time.
              We have a STEAM game we created called Beat The Expert so this will help access player performance as we use basketball to teach mathematics.</p>
          <p>What I am addressing may have many factors that determine a players shooting performance.  Some of the advanced metrics include effective field goal percentage and effecitive shot quality.  I will be creating innovative shot plots, heat maps, and box scores for our youth players.</p>
          <p>I appreiciate you going on this journey with me as I know it will be fun. Below is some of my story.</p>"
