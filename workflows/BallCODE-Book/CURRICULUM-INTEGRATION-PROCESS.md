---

## PHASE 3: RESEARCH & EXPERT CONSULTATION

### Research
**Action:** Review educational research and best practices
**Focus:** Age-appropriate concepts, pedagogical approaches
**Deliverable:** Research-backed integration

### Expert Consultation (AIMCODE Advisory Board)
**Apply:**
- Zhang: Story-first approach
- Resnick: Constructionist learning
- Reggio: Multiple entry points

## PHASE 4: BUILD-MEASURE-LEARN CYCLE

### BUILD Phase
**Actions:**
1. Create update template
2. Update Priority 1 files
3. Update Priority 2 files
4. Verify consistency
5. Document process

**Deliverables:**
- All files updated
- Integration complete
- Documentation created

### MEASURE Phase
**Metrics:**
- Update completion rate
- Consistency across documents
- Integration quality
- AIMCODE alignment

**Tools:**
- Update checklist
- Consistency verification
- AIMCODE validation checklist

**Deliverable:** Measurement report

### LEARN Phase
**Analysis:**
- What integration patterns worked best?
- What needs improvement?
- How can we enhance the process?
- What feedback did we receive?

**Refinements:**
- Update integration patterns
- Improve documentation
- Enhance consistency
- Refine AIMCODE application

**Deliverable:** Learnings document

### REPEAT Phase
**Next Cycle:**
- Apply learnings to next integration
- Improve process documentation
- Enhance AIMCODE application
- Better integration patterns

**Deliverable:** Improved process for next iteration

## STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

### Step 1: Create Update Template
**Action:** Create template with standard integration sections
**File:** `CURRICULUM-UPDATE-TEMPLATE.md`
**Content:**
- Book update sections
- Supplementary resources template
- Real-world integration template
- Code examples template

### Step 2: Update Priority 1 Files
**Order:**
1. CURRICULUM-SHOWCASE-COMPLETE.md
2. BALLCODE-CURRICULUM-OUTLINE.md
3. ENHANCED-PYTHON-CURRICULUM-COMPLETE.md
4. PYTHON-CURRICULUM-STRUCTURE.md

**For Each File:**
- Add integration sections
- Update relevant book sections
- Add supplementary resources
- Update learning objectives
- Add code examples

### Step 3: Update Priority 2 Files
**Order:**
1. CURRICULUM-OUTLINE-VISUAL.md
2. IBM-Protected-Curriculum-Outline.md
3. IBM-SATURDAY-PRESENTATION-PACKAGE.md
4. BOOK-LAYOUT-CURRICULUM-AIMCODE-INTEGRATION.md
5. Curriculum-Expansion-Plan.md
6. Sample-Curriculum-Examples.md
7. CURRICULUM-ENHANCEMENT-SUMMARY.md

**For Each File:**
- Add references
- Update relevant sections
- Maintain document-specific focus

### Step 4: Verification
**Check:**
- All files updated
- Consistent messaging
- AIMCODE principles maintained
- Integration quality verified
- Repository URLs correct

### Step 5: Documentation
**Create:**
- CURRICULUM-INTEGRATION-COMPLETE.md (summary)
- CURRICULUM-UPDATE-LOG.md (tracking)
- CURRICULUM-INTEGRATION-PROCESS.md (this document)
