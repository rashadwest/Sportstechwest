## 📝 STORY STRUCTURE (QUICK REFERENCE)

### **ACT I: The Reactive Defender + Data Mystery (~450 words)**

**Key Points:**
- One-on-one, defender reacts instantly
- Nova tries simple fakes - fails
- Coach: "This defender has a pattern. We need data."
- Arc: "Data fetching needed. Pattern analysis required."
- End: Nova decides to learn loops AND data analysis

**Basketball First:** Start with action, not explanation

---

### **ACT II: Pattern Loop + Data Analysis (~550 words)**

**Key Points:**
- Defender gets better, time pressure increases
- Arc fetches data from Ball Don't Lie API (simplified explanation)
- Nova learns: REPEAT [fake left] 3 TIMES, THEN [go right]
- Data shows: 87% left reactions
- Connection: "Data finds pattern, loop executes pattern"

**Learning Moment:** Show, don't explain

---

### **ACT III: Breaking the Loop + Success (~500 words)**

**Key Points:**
- Final seconds, shot clock running
- Arc: "Data shows 87% left. Strategy: Fake left 3x, then go right."
- Nova executes: Fake, fake, fake → Go right
- Defender falls for it (data prediction works!)
- Success: "Loops work! Data helps!"

**Climax:** High stakes, clear success

---

## 🎯 KEY MESSAGES (Keep Simple)

1. **Primary:** "Loops repeat patterns, then break them"
2. **Secondary:** "Data helps find patterns"
3. **Connection:** "Data → Pattern → Loop → Success"
