## GOAL & CLARITY

### 1. What exactly do I want? (Be specific, not vague)

**ELI10 Answer:** 
I want my computer to work super fast when I'm typing and using AI help, like it used to. Right now, when I type, the words appear slowly after I type them (like a slow echo). I want it to be instant again, like talking to a friend who responds immediately. I also want my computer to be smarter about storing files so it doesn't get slow.

**Technical Answer:**
Goal: Optimize local AI cursor system's performance and markdown file management to minimize slowdowns. Identify key bottlenecks in performance, optimize storage, and ensure smooth operation on the local machine. Ultimately, outperform cloud solutions by refining local performance.

---

### 2. What does success look like?

**ELI10 Answer:**
Success means:
- When I type, words appear instantly (no waiting)
- The AI helper responds super fast (like a smart friend who knows everything)
- My computer doesn't slow down even when I have lots of files open
- Everything feels smooth and fast, like a race car instead of a bicycle

**Technical Answer:**
Success: The system runs without noticeable lag, the AI cursor performs smoothly even with large datasets, and markdown files are managed efficiently without excessive storage use. Local performance should be faster and more reliable than cloud alternatives. Files are stored optimally to avoid unnecessary bloat.

---

### 3. What are the constraints?

**ELI10 Answer:**
The limits I have to work with:
- My computer has a certain amount of space (like a backpack - it can only hold so much)
- My computer's brain (processor) can only think so fast
- I don't have an extra hard drive right now (like not having a second backpack)
- I still need to be able to use my computer for other things (can't break it while fixing it)

**Technical Answer:**
Constraints:
- Limited local storage (currently without an external drive)
- Processing power of the local machine (potential bottleneck in AI processing)
- File size and frequency of markdown updates
- Ensuring the system is still usable for interactive tasks (i.e., maintaining usability while optimizing)

---

### 4. Who is the audience?

**ELI10 Answer:**
The people who will use this:
- Me (the main person using it)
- Other people who might work on this project later
- The computer itself (it needs to understand what to do)

**Technical Answer:**
Audience: Primarily developers (myself and potentially others working on this system), system admins, and the local machine that will handle the execution.

---

## FORMAT & LOGIC

### 5. What structure do I need? (List, table, script, outline, code, document, etc.)

**ELI10 Answer:**
I need:
- A checklist (like a to-do list) of things to check and fix
- A speedometer (like in a car) to see how fast things are running
- A guidebook (step-by-step instructions) on how to make things faster
- A report card (to see if things got better)

**Technical Answer:**
Structure: A combination of performance monitoring scripts (to track memory usage, CPU, and file operations), a step-by-step troubleshooting guide, and possibly a performance report that can be regularly reviewed. This will include markdown management strategies as part of the optimization.

---

### 6. What's the logical flow or sequence?

**ELI10 Answer:**
The order of doing things:
1. First, figure out what's slow (like checking why a car won't start)
2. Look at my files (see which ones are too big or messy)
3. Clean up storage (like organizing a messy room)
4. Make the AI system smarter (teach it to work faster)
5. Use best practices (do things the right way)
6. Test to make sure it works (drive the car to see if it's fixed)

**Technical Answer:**
1. Identify current slowdowns: Monitor and pinpoint performance issues with CPU, RAM, disk usage, etc.
2. Assess markdown file usage: Evaluate how markdown files are stored, read, and processed.
3. Optimize local storage: Identify storage strategies (e.g., offloading heavy files, using external drives).
4. Optimize AI cursor system: Evaluate the AI cursor logic for potential inefficiencies.
5. Implement best practices: Use optimal solutions based on findings, ensuring minimal file load and efficient memory usage.
6. Test improvements: Ensure system performance has improved, both in the AI cursor system and markdown file management.

---

### 7. How should this be organized?

**ELI10 Answer:**
Like organizing a toolbox:
- One drawer for checking speed (monitoring tools)
- One drawer for organizing files (file management)
- One drawer for making AI faster (AI optimization)
- Everything labeled clearly so I know where to find things

**Technical Answer:**
Organization: The system should be structured to isolate the AI cursor, markdown file management, and system performance optimization as separate but interconnected components. There should be a monitoring script that can detect bottlenecks, a storage optimization guide for markdown files, and an AI optimization checklist.

---

### 8. What steps should be followed?

**ELI10 Answer:**
The step-by-step plan:
1. Check how fast things are running (like checking a car's speed)
2. Look at all my files and see which ones are too big (like cleaning out a closet)
3. Move big files somewhere else if needed (like putting winter clothes in storage)
4. Make the AI system work smarter, not harder (like teaching someone a better way to do homework)
5. Organize files better (like organizing a bookshelf)
6. Make sure everything still works (test drive)

**Technical Answer:**
1. Monitor system performance: Track memory, CPU, storage, and file load times.
2. Audit markdown file management: Identify which files are taking up space and determine if some can be offloaded to an external drive or cloud storage.
3. Investigate the AI cursor logic: Check for inefficiencies in cursor calculations, file loading times, or unnecessary operations.
4. Implement storage management solutions: Set up file compression, indexing, or external storage where appropriate.
5. Optimize AI system execution: Optimize the processing loop and memory usage for cursor-related tasks.

## GUARDRAILS & ADAPTATION

### 9. What accuracy standards are required?

**ELI10 Answer:**
I need to be really close to perfect:
- Speed measurements should be almost exactly right (like a stopwatch, not guessing)
- The AI should understand things correctly almost all the time (like a smart student who gets 98% on tests)
- It's okay to be off by a tiny bit (like being 1 second off on a timer), but not by a lot

**Technical Answer:**
Accuracy: High accuracy is needed for performance metrics (e.g., CPU usage, disk space usage), AI cursor behavior, and file management. 1-2% error margin is acceptable for testing performance improvements but should be addressed if noticeable.

---

### 10. What tone/style should be used?

**ELI10 Answer:**
Write it like a helpful instruction manual:
- Clear and easy to understand (like explaining to a friend)
- Use facts and numbers (like a science report)
- Be helpful and problem-solving (like a teacher helping with homework)
- Be precise and careful (like a doctor writing notes)

**Technical Answer:**
Tone: Technical, data-driven, and clear. Use a problem-solving tone for communicating issues and solutions with a focus on precision and performance.

---

### 11. What should be avoided?

**ELI10 Answer:**
Don't do these things:
- Don't guess without checking (like not guessing why something is broken)
- Don't try random things without testing (like not randomly pushing buttons)
- Don't rely on cloud if I can make local work better (like not asking for help if I can figure it out myself)

**Technical Answer:**
Avoid: Making assumptions without data, relying on trial-and-error without proper testing. Avoid unnecessary cloud dependency if local optimization can provide better performance.

---

### 12. What constraints or limitations exist?

**ELI10 Answer:**
The things that might make it hard:
- I might not have enough storage space (like a small backpack)
- My computer might not be as powerful as cloud computers (like a regular bike vs a race car)
- I might not have special tools to check everything (like not having a mechanic's tools)
- I have to check things myself (like not having a helper)

**Technical Answer:**
Limitations:
- Possible lack of immediate storage space without external drives
- Local system may be less powerful than cloud infrastructure for certain tasks
- Potential difficulties in AI optimization without code profiling tools
- File management efficiency tied to manual monitoring

---

### 13. What flexibility is needed?

**ELI10 Answer:**
I need to be able to change plans:
- If something doesn't work, try a different way (like if one road is closed, take another)
- Be ready to adjust based on what I find (like changing a recipe if an ingredient isn't available)
- Make sure it works with different types of files and systems (like a universal charger that works with different phones)

**Technical Answer:**
Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust strategies depending on real-time data, especially if hardware limitations prevent certain optimizations. Ensure the solution can adapt to various markdown structures and AI systems.

---

### 20. What systems thinking is needed?

**ELI10 Answer:**
Think about how everything connects:
- The AI system, file storage, and computer speed all affect each other (like how a car's engine, gas tank, and wheels all work together)
- When I fix one thing, I need to make sure it doesn't break another (like fixing a bike tire but making sure the brakes still work)
- Everything needs to work together smoothly (like a team where everyone helps each other)

**Technical Answer:**
Systems Thinking: The AI cursor, markdown file management, and local performance optimizations are interconnected systems. Optimizing each system requires consideration of how the cursor system interacts with memory, how markdown files are read/processed, and how storage impacts system performance.
