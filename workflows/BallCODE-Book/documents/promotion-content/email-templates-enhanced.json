Not coding ABOUT basketball, but coding THROUGH basketball stories.\n\nThat's BallCODE. Students learn coding logic by calling plays. They learn math by analyzing shots. They learn AI by reading defenses.\n\n**Why I'm Reaching Out:**\nI know {school_name} has {specific_program}, and I think BallCODE could be a great fit. We're offering a **completely free pilot program** to select schools.\n\n**What You Get:**\n- Complete Episode 1 content\n- Teacher resources (ready to use)\n- Student access to interactive games\n- Ongoing support\n- **Be part of our CES 2026 launch** (January 7-10)\n\n**No pressure - just a remarkable opportunity.**\n\nI'd love to schedule a quick 15-minute call to see if this might work for your students. Would you be available for a brief conversation this week?\n\nThanks, and I hope to catch up soon!\n\nBest,\nRashad West\nCreator, BallCODE\n{email}\n{phone}",

    "body_template": "Dear {contact_name},\n\nI noticed {school_name} has {specific_program}, and I think you'd find this interesting.\n\n**Here's what's different:**\n\nMost coding education feels like work. Kids learn concepts they can't see or touch.\n\nBallCODE is different. We teach coding through basketball stories. When students call a play, they're learning sequences. When they analyze a shot, they're learning probability. When they read a defense, they're learning pattern recognition.\n\n**The Remarkable Part:**\nStudents don't realize they're learning coding. They think they're playing basketball.\n\n**What You Get (Completely Free):**\n- Episode 1: \"The Tip-off Trial\" (complete story + exercises)\n- Teacher guide (ready to use, minimal prep)\n- Interactive game components\n- Student access (no login required)\n- Ongoing support\n- **Be part of our CES 2026 launch** (January 7-10)\n\n**What We're Looking For:**\n- 2-4 week pilot commitment\n- Feedback on what works (and what doesn't)\n- Optional: Testimonials (if you love it)\n- Optional: Case study (anonymized if preferred)\n\n**No pressure. No commitment. Just a remarkable opportunity.**\n\nWould you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if this could work for your students?\n\nBest regards,\nRashad West\nCreator, BallCODE\n{email}\n{phone}",

Kids learn \"if-then\" statements without context.\n\nBallCODE is different. We teach coding through basketball stories. Students learn:\n- Coding logic by calling plays\n- Math concepts by analyzing shots\n- AI fundamentals by reading defenses\n\n**The Remarkable Results:**\n- 10 pilot schools already running\n- Students actually understand coding (not just memorize)\n- Teachers say it's the most engaging STEM program they've seen\n- **Launching at CES 2026** (January 7-10)\n\n**What You Get (Free Pilot - No Strings):**\n- Complete Episode 1: \"The Tip-off Trial\"\n- Teacher guide with learning objectives\n- Interactive game exercises\n- Student access (no login required)\n- Ongoing support\n- **Featured in our CES launch story** (if you want)\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nThis isn't just another educational program. It's a new way to teach coding - through the language kids already speak: basketball.\n\n**Limited Opportunity:**\nWe're accepting the next 50 schools for our pilot program. {school_name} could be one of them.\n\n**No pressure, no commitment - just a remarkable opportunity.**\n\nInterested?
