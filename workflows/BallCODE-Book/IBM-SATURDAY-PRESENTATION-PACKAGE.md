**Python Concept:** If/then conditionals

**What Students Learn:**
- Block Coding: IF/THEN blocks
- Python Foundation: `if condition: action`
- Concept: Conditional logic - make decisions

**Python Code Example:**
```python
# Reading defense - conditionals
if defender_goes_left:
    crossover_right()
elif defender_goes_right:
    crossover_left()
else:
    drive_straight()
```

### Book 3: The Pattern (In & Out Dribble) - UPDATED ⚠️
**Status:** Outline Ready - Ready for Writing Tomorrow - **NOW WITH DATA INTEGRATION**

**Basketball Context:** Repeated moves, patterns, deception + **Data-driven strategy**  
**Python Concept:** Loops and repetition + **Data fetching and analysis**

**What Students Learn:**
- Block Coding: REPEAT blocks, loops + **Data fetching blocks**
- Python Foundation: `for` loops, `while` loops + **Data analysis**
- Concept: Repetition - do something multiple times + **Data helps find patterns**

**Python Code Example:**
```python
# Pattern repetition - loops
for move in range(3):
    fake_left()
    go_right()
    if defender_falls_for_fake:
        break

# NEW: Data fetching and analysis
opponent_data = fetch_opponent_stats()
for game in opponent_data:
    if game.reaction == "left":
        left_count += 1
```

**Supplementary Resource:**
- "Learn to Code with Basketball" by Nathan Braun

## 🎓 PYTHON CURRICULUM OVERVIEW

### Three-Phase Learning Pathway

**Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)**
- Students learn coding concepts using basketball terminology
- Visual block interface (no typing required)
- Drag blocks together to create programs
- Immediate feedback through integrated game exercises

**Phase 2: Transition Bridge**

- Side-by-side view of blocks and code
- Understand that blocks = code
- See Python syntax alongside blocks

**Phase 3: Python Learning**
- Students progress to Python syntax
- Same concepts, different representation
- Real-world programming skills
- Write actual Python code

---
