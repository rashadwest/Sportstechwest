**The Solution:** Four distinct AIMCODE frameworks, each optimized for its sector:
1. **Website AIMCODE** - Technical deployment, hosting, user experience
2. **Book AIMCODE** - Story creation, educational content, visual design
3. **Curriculum AIMCODE** - Learning pathways, standards alignment, assessment
4. **Game AIMCODE** - Unity development, game mechanics, player experience
