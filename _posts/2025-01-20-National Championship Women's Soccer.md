## The Decision to Go

When I saw the Women’s National Championship game being broadcast on [**ESPN**](https://www.espn.com/espnw/), it hit me. This wasn’t just any game. It was happening right in **Cary, NC**, just minutes from my hometown of [**Raleigh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina). How could I not go? **UNC Women’s Soccer** has a legacy worth witnessing in person, and I wanted to experience that energy firsthand.

## The Journey to the Stadium

Parking in Cary? **Chaos**. Finding a spot was one thing, but getting to the actual stadium was another. I had to navigate through a **maze**—out to the street, around a patch of forest, and finally to the field. By the time I arrived, it felt like I had already been on an adventure. Little did I know, the trip back to my car later would be even more eventful.

## The Atmosphere

The first thing I noticed? **Carolina Blue** everywhere. About **90%** of the crowd was made up of UNC fans, and it’s not hard to see why. **UNC Women’s Soccer** isn’t just dominant—they’re **legendary**. Consider this: over **40 NCAA Tournament appearances**, **32 Final Fours**, and a mind-blowing **22 National Championships**. They have defined what it means to be the gold standard in college sports.

## 62 & The Game Itself

First Half Possession vs. Second Half Adjustments
Wake Forest controlled the first half with 62% possession, more shots, and more corners, keeping UNC on the back foot. But in the second half, UNC flipped the script, retaining more possession and creating better attacking opportunities.

One big difference? Olivia Thomas started finding more space. UNC’s adjustments allowed her to get on the ball in dangerous areas, leading to more chances to get a shot off. The breakthrough came in the 62nd minute and that was all they needed.

UNC didn’t play their best defensive game. Wake Forest still had chances, but UNC came out unscathed. Sometimes, it’s not about locking down defensively but making the most of your key moments.

What to ask: How did UNC’s tactical shift open up space for Olivia? Did they press higher or just transition more efficiently?

Lastly, the game was intense but scrappy. Neither team had a clear upper hand and it was constant back and forth. But then UNC’s attack started breaking through. Their pressure led to a big opportunity: a free kick right outside the penalty box. It was one of those moments where the air in the stadium changes.

The 62% possession in the first half, followed by UNC flipping the script and scoring in the 62nd minute, perfectly illustrates the shift in momentum.

The shot was **perfect**. Struck clean, it sailed past the keeper and into the back of the net. That goal would seal the game and give UNC yet another **championship** to add to their historic legacy.

## The Celebration

After the final whistle, the stadium erupted. Fans, alums, and even casual spectators were caught up in the **joy** of the moment. I met some **UNC grads** who were thrilled to share their school pride and talk about what brought me to the game. The energy was **infectious**.

Unfortunately, my phone was nearly **dead**, so I couldn’t capture the postgame celebrations as much as I wanted to. That was a little frustrating, but being there in the moment made up for it.

## The Journey Back

Getting back to my car was a whole new adventure. This time, I decided to take the **shortcut through the woods**. With my phone completely **dead**, I had to depend on the person in front of me and their flashlight to guide the way. Thankfully, I made it out without twisting an ankle or getting lost.

Once I got to my car, the parking lot was **gridlocked**. With no phone to distract me, I turned on the **radio** and used the time to reflect. Sitting there, I couldn’t help but appreciate the experience: the game, the crowd, and what it meant to witness such a **historic program** in action.

## Final Reflections

This wasn’t just a game; it was an **experience**. From the **chaos of parking** to the **electric atmosphere** of a UNC championship win, the night was **unforgettable**. It reminded me of why sports matter so much. They’re about more than **competition**—they’re about **shared moments**, **passion**, and the stories we get to take home.
