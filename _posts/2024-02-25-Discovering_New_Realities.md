## Witnessing the Growth of XR at MIT

Being in [Boston](https://www.bostonusa.com/) for the [MIT XR Hackathon](https://realityvirtuallyhack.com/) was a powerful reminder of how far the **XR field** has come and the part I’ve been able to play in it. As one of the early contributors to this space, it felt special to see its evolution firsthand. Working alongside some of the best **XR developers** at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) was incredible. The conversations I had were inspiring, especially with people who are not only innovating but actively reshaping how **immersive technology** is experienced.

## Exploring the Latest Advancements in XR Technology

Seeing the latest advancements in **headsets** and **3D printing technology** gave me new insights into where XR is headed. This experience motivated me more than ever to keep pushing forward in this field. On top of the tech and networking, I also had the chance to see my dad’s side of the family and reconnect with friends from my early days in XR, including familiar faces from the [Oculus LaunchPad](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/introducing-start-and-launch-pad-support-for-horizon-worlds/). These events bring together both the professional and personal sides of my journey, making it all the more meaningful.

## Building New Relationships in the XR Community

I also formed new relationships in the **XR community** that I’m excited to grow. One of the most intriguing conversations was about an **immersive innovation building** at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), which I hear is a standout in immersive experiences. I’m already planning a visit to experience it firsthand soon.

## Renewed Drive to Innovate in XR

The MIT XR Hackathon reminded me why I entered this field and renewed my drive to keep exploring, creating, and connecting. I’m looking forward to integrating everything I’ve gained here into my own projects and pushing the boundaries of what XR can offer.
