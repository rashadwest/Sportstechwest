Hi [Developer Name],

I've created my own Netlify account and need to transfer the BallCODE project to my account so I can manage it directly. Can you help with one of these options?

**OPTION 1 (Preferred - Easiest):** Transfer the site ownership
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Select the BallCODE site
- Site Settings → General → Transfer site ownership
- Enter my email: [YOUR EMAIL HERE]
- I'll accept the transfer and the site will move to my account

**OPTION 2:** Add me to GitHub repository
- Add me as collaborator to the GitHub repo: [REPOSITORY NAME]
- My GitHub username: [YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]
- I'll connect it to my Netlify account and deploy it

**OPTION 3:** Give me the code files
- Zip the project files
- Send me the zip file or share via Google Drive/Dropbox
- I'll deploy it to my Netlify account manually

**Also need from you:**
- Current Netlify site name/URL (e.g., `ballcode.netlify.app`)
- Build settings (build command, publish directory - if any)
- Any environment variables or configuration needed
- Unity project location (if separate from website)

**My Netlify account:**
- Email: [YOUR EMAIL HERE]
- I've already created the account and am ready to receive the transfer

Thanks for your help!
