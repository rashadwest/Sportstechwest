# Python Coding Game Roadmap
## Simple Approach: 1-2 Levels for Ideation

**Date:** December 10, 2025  
**Status:** Roadmap Item  
**Priority:** Medium (Advanced feature, ideation phase)  
**Purpose:** Add Python coding game mode for students to write actual Python code

---

## 🎯 GOAL

Create a Python coding game mode that:
- Allows students to write Python code (not just blocks)
- Connects blocks to Python (shows the transition)
- Uses basketball terminology in Python
- Simple implementation (1-2 levels for ideation)
- Tests concept before full build

**Approach:** Keep it simple - 1-2 levels to ideate and test the concept

---

## 📊 CURRENT STATE

**What We Have:**
- ✅ Block coding game (working)
- ✅ Students see blocks → Python code connection (in books)
- ✅ Python examples in curriculum
- ❌ No Python coding game mode
- ❌ No way to write Python code in game
- ❌ No Python code execution

**What We Need:**
- Python code editor in game
- Code execution engine
- Basketball-to-Python terminology mapping
- Simple level structure
- Feedback system

## 🎮 PYTHON GAME MODE CONCEPT

### ELI10: What Is Python Coding Game?

**Think of it like writing a recipe, but in Python code instead of blocks!**

**How It Works:**
1. **You see a code editor** (like a text box)
2. **You write Python code** using basketball words:
   ```python
   start()
   pound_dribble()
   pound_dribble()
   pound_dribble()
   advance()
   bucket()
   ```

3. **You click "RUN"** and watch your robot do what you coded!

4. **You see your code work** just like the blocks did!

**The Connection:**
- **Blocks:** START → POUND → POUND → POUND → BUCKET
- **Python:** `start()`, `pound_dribble()`, `pound_dribble()`, `pound_dribble()`, `bucket()`
- **Same thing, different language!**

**What You're Learning:**
- How to write Python code
- How blocks = Python code
- Real programming skills
- Basketball terminology in code

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Ideation (1-2 Levels) - Current Focus

**Goal:** Test the concept, see if students like it

**Level 1: "Your First Python Code"**
- **Concept:** Write simple sequence in Python
- **Task:** Write code to pound 3 times, then shoot
- **Python:**
  ```python
  start()
  pound_dribble()
  pound_dribble()
  pound_dribble()
  bucket()
  ```
- **Learning:** Basic Python syntax, sequences
- **Difficulty:** Beginner

**Level 2: "Blocks to Python"**
- **Concept:** See blocks, write Python equivalent
- **Task:** Given blocks, write Python code
- **Blocks:** START → CROSSOVER → IN & OUT → BUCKET
- **Python:**
  ```python
  start()
  crossover_dribble()
  in_out_dribble()
  bucket()
  ```
- **Learning:** Translation from blocks to code
- **Difficulty:** Beginner

**Features Needed:**
- Simple code editor
- Basic Python execution
- Basketball function library
- Error messages (simple)
- Success feedback

### Phase 2: Expansion (If Ideation Successful)

**Goal:** Build full Python mode

**Additional Levels:**
- Conditionals in Python
- Loops in Python
- Functions in Python
- Advanced Python concepts

**Features:**
- Full Python editor
- Syntax highlighting
- Error handling
- Code hints/autocomplete
- Progress tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)

**Goal:** Full Python learning system

**Features:**
- Python tutorials
- Code challenges
- Project-based learning
- Python certification
- Advanced concepts
