## 🚀 Action Plan

**For Tomorrow Morning:**
1. Set Book 1: $5

3. Set Bundle: $12 (if doing bundle)
4. Launch and test
5. After 1-2 months, analyze and adjust

**Remember:**
- You can always raise prices later
- Harder to lower prices (feels like devaluation)
- Start accessible, build audience, then optimize

---

**Bottom Line:** $5 is good for accessibility and building audience. Add a bundle at $12 to increase revenue. Consider free intros to maximize reach. You can always test and adjust!

## School-first licensing (recommended primary model)

Schools rarely want to buy individual $5 items as the core procurement model. The procurement-friendly structure is:

- **Pilot (time-boxed):** low/no cost → proof + testimonials
- **Classroom annual license:** 1 teacher / ~35 students
- **School/site annual license:** whole building
- **District license:** custom
