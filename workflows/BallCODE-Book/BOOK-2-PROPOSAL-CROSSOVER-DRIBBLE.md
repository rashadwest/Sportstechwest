## SYNOPSIS

Nova faces a defender who reads every move. She tries to go the same direction every time, but the defender is always there, blocking her path. Frustration mounts as every attempt fails.

Nova learns that basketball, like coding, requires making decisions based on what you see. The crossover dribble—changing direction based on what the defense shows—is like coding's "if/then" logic: if the defense goes left, then crossover right.

With Arc's help identifying decision patterns and Coach Circuit's wisdom about reading and reacting, Nova masters conditional logic. She learns to read the defense, make smart decisions, and use if/then thinking to get past her opponent.

## PLOT SUMMARY

### Act I: Setup and Problem

**Opening Scene:** One-on-one situation. A defender stands in front of Nova, blocking her path to the basket.

**Main Conflict:** Nova tries to go the same direction every time—always left, always predictable. The defender reads her moves perfectly and is always there, blocking every attempt.

**Basketball Challenge:** The "Reading Defender" predicts every movement. Nova can't get past because she's predictable. No matter how fast she moves, the defender anticipates her direction.

**Character Introduction:** Nova is frustrated, stuck in a pattern. Arc detects the problem: "Decision logic missing. No conditional response." Coach Circuit provides wisdom: "Read the defense. If they go left, you go right. That's the logic."

**Inciting Incident:** After multiple failed attempts going the same way, Nova realizes: "Maybe I need to read and react?"

---

### Act II: Learning and Struggle

**Rising Action:** The defender gets better at reading Nova's moves. Every attempt is predicted and blocked. Time is running out.

**Learning Moment:** Nova practices the crossover dribble, but this time she learns to read the defense first. She begins to see it as conditional logic: "If defense goes left, then crossover right. If defense goes right, then crossover left."

**Concept Introduction:**
- **AI Concept:** Decision Trees and Conditional Logic emerge. Arc helps identify patterns: "If defender moves left, then crossover right. If defender moves right, then crossover left." Decision trees show multiple paths based on conditions.
- **Math Concept:** Probability and Decision Making appear. "If defender goes left 70% of the time, crossover right 70% of the time." Decision making based on probability, basic statistics for tracking patterns.
- **Coding Concept:** If/Then Conditionals are introduced. "IF defender goes left, THEN crossover right." Conditional blocks: "IF [condition], THEN [action]." Code makes decisions based on conditions.

**Struggle:** Nova initially resists: "I just want to go straight, why do I need to decide?" Coach Circuit explains: "Basketball is about reading and reacting. Code is the same." Through practice, it clicks: "Oh, if/then logic helps me make better decisions!"

**Turning Point:** Nova realizes that making decisions based on conditions is the key. She sees the connection between reading the defense and coding's if/then logic.

---

### Act III: Resolution and Application

**Climax:** Final seconds. Nova needs to get past the defender or the opportunity is lost. This is the moment of truth.

**Solution:** Nova reads the defender's movement. She uses if/then logic: "IF defender goes left, THEN crossover right." She makes the decision based on what she sees.

**Basketball Success:** Nova successfully crosses over, gets past the defender, and creates a scoring opportunity. The conditional logic works!

**Resolution:** Nova understands that if/then logic enables smart decisions. The team scores, and Nova reflects: "Conditional logic works! I can make smart decisions!"

**Connection Made:** Nova makes the clear connection: "Coding uses if/then to make decisions, just like basketball. Read the conditions, then react."

## BLOCK CODING GAME INTEGRATION

### Training Mode
- **Activity:** Students drag IF/THEN blocks with Block 2 (Crossover)
- **Blocks Used:** IF [condition] THEN [Block 2 Crossover], ELSE [Block 2 Crossover]
- **Learning Objective:** Practice: IF [defender left] THEN [Block 2 right] ELSE [Block 2 left]. Learn that conditionals help make decisions.

### Math Mode
- **Activity:** Students calculate probability and make decisions
- **Calculations:** "If defender goes left 70%, crossover right 70%." Decision making: "What's the best choice based on probability?"
- **Example:** Track defender movements: Left 7 times, Right 3 times. Probability: 70% left, 30% right. Best decision: Crossover right 70% of the time.

### Coding Mode
- **Activity:** Students create conditional sequences
- **Code Structure:** IF [defender left] THEN [Block 2 right] ELSE [Block 2 left]

## AUTHOR NOTES

This book introduces conditional logic, which is fundamental to all programming. It's critical that students understand if/then thinking and decision-making based on conditions.

The crossover dribble is the perfect vehicle for teaching conditionals because it requires reading the defense and making a decision. This connects naturally to coding's if/then logic.
