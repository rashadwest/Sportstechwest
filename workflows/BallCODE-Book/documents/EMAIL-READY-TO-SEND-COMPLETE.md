Subject: Request: GitHub Repository & Netlify Access Transfer for BallCODE Website

---

Hey [Name],

I'm working to get everything ready so I can start selling the service, but things were moving too slow, so I've automated everything. I'll start building a team once we're generating consistent revenue.

For now, I need your help with the following:

GitHub Repository Transfer

I need the BallCODE website repository transferred to my GitHub account so I can manage deployments and updates directly.

What I need:
- Transfer the repository JuddCMelvin/BallCode to my GitHub account: rashadwest
- This will allow me to clone it locally and manage all deployments

Why this is needed:
- I've automated the deployment process and need direct repository access
- This will enable faster updates and better workflow management
- I'll be able to push changes directly without delays

Netlify Access Transfer

I also need Netlify access for the BallCODE website deployment.

What I need:
- Access to the Netlify account/site for ballcode.co
- This will allow me to manage deployments directly
- I can set up automated deployments from GitHub

How to transfer Netlify:

Please contact Netlify support at support@netlify.com to transfer the site (ballcode.co) to my account: rashadwest@gmail.com

They will need:
- Current site name: ballcode.co
- Current account holder information
- New account email: rashadwest@gmail.com

Moving Forward:

Once I have both the GitHub repository and Netlify access:
- I'll be able to deploy updates automatically
- The website will update automatically on every push
- I can monitor and manage all deployments
- Everything will be ready for launch and sales

Timeline:
- I'm ready to take this over immediately
- Once transferred, I can have everything set up within 24 hours
- This will unblock the sales and launch timeline

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are any steps I should take on my end.

Thanks,
Rashad
