**Purpose:** Saturday Teaser Presentation for IBM Partnership  
**Slides:** 9 slides (10-15 minute presentation)  
**Status:** Ready to convert to PowerPoint/Keynote

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** BallCODE  
**Subtitle:** Learn how robots think—through the game you love.

**Content:**
- **Rashad West**
- Founder, BallCODE
- Partnership Opportunity
- [Date]

**Visual Notes:**
- BallCODE logo (if available)
- Basketball + code elements
- Clean, modern design
- Professional appearance

**Talking Point:** "Thank you for your time today. I'm excited to share BallCODE—a unique approach to STEM education that bridges sports and coding."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Title:** The Challenge: Low STEM Engagement

**Content:**

**The Numbers:**
- 50+ million students in target age range (grades 3-8)
- Traditional coding education struggles with engagement
- Underrepresented groups particularly affected
- Gap between student interests and STEM education

**The Reality:**
- Kids love basketball
- They don't always love coding
- What if we could bridge that gap?

**Visual Notes:**
- Statistics or data visualization
- Simple graphic showing the gap
- Basketball imagery

**Talking Point:** "We have a massive opportunity—50 million students who need STEM education, but traditional approaches aren't engaging them. Kids already understand basketball. What if we used that to teach coding?"

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

**Title:** BallCODE: Sports-to-Code Learning Pathway

**Content:**

**What We've Built:**
- First-of-its-kind curriculum that bridges sports and coding
- Uses basketball context students already understand
- Progressive pathway: Sports Language → Code Bridge → Python
- 70% story, 30% instruction (engagement-focused)

**The Approach:**
- We use what kids already know (basketball)
- To teach what they need to learn (coding)
- Making computational thinking intuitive and fun

**Visual Notes:**
- Diagram showing the 3-phase pathway
- Basketball + code fusion graphic
- Visual representation of the bridge

**Talking Point:** "BallCODE is the first curriculum that truly bridges sports and coding. We start where students are—with basketball—and take them where they need to go—to Python programming."

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

**Title:** Three-Phase Learning Pathway

**Content:**

**Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)**
- Students learn using basketball terminology
- Visual block interface (no typing required)
- Immediate feedback through game integration
- Example: "If player is open, then pass the ball"

**Phase 2: Transition Bridge**
- See how sports language maps to code
- Blocks and code side-by-side
- Understanding that blocks = code
- Example: See the block code next to Python equivalent

**Phase 3: Python Learning**
- Progress to Python syntax
- Same concepts, different representation
- Real-world programming skills
- Example: Write actual Python code for game logic

**Visual Notes:**
- Three-column layout showing each phase
- Progressive diagram
- Example code snippets

**Talking Point:** "We start with sports language—something kids already understand. Then we show them how that maps to code. Finally, they're writing real Python. It's a natural progression."

## Slide 5: Episode 1 Preview

**Title:** Episode 1: The Tip-off Trial

**Content:**

- Understanding variables and state transitions
- If/then logic in basketball context

- Controlled outlet → Fill lanes → Safe entry
- Maintaining state across three linked actions

**What Students Experience:**
