## Q&A Preparation (Strategic Answers)

**Q: Why should IBM invest in this instead of building it themselves?**
**A:** "Great question. IBM could build it, but we've already built the foundation—Episode 1 is complete, we have a university partnership that validates the approach, and we have real data integration that makes it authentic. Plus, we're proposing a partnership model where IBM gets market leadership and a data platform while we handle the content and platform development. It's faster, lower risk, and creates a strategic partnership rather than just a vendor relationship."

**Q: What's the ROI for IBM?**
**A:** "The ROI is multi-faceted. First, market leadership in a new category—sports-to-code education. Second, a data platform that generates valuable learning analytics and basketball data insights. Third, research partnerships that enable publications and thought leadership. Fourth, scalable revenue streams from education, data licensing, and research. And fifth, brand positioning as an education innovation leader. We're proposing a $50K-$100K pilot to prove the model, then scale to $200K-$500K and eventually $500K-$1M+ as we own the market."

**Q: How does the Kentucky State partnership help IBM?**
**A:** "The Kentucky State partnership provides three key benefits: First, academic validation—university partnership validates our educational approach and reduces risk. Second, real data integration—Kentucky State Analytics data makes game scenarios authentic and engaging. Third, research collaboration—university partnership enables research studies that IBM can co-publish, creating thought leadership and credibility. It's not just a partnership—it's a credibility and data asset."

**Q: What if the pilot doesn't work?**
**A:** "That's why we're proposing a crawl-walk-run approach. The initial $50K-$100K investment is a pilot to prove the model works. If it doesn't work, IBM has limited exposure and we've learned valuable lessons. If it does work—which we're confident it will, given our university partnership and proven Episode 1—then we scale together. The risk is mitigated by the phased approach and proven foundation."

**Q: How does this fit with IBM's existing educational initiatives?**
**A:** "IBM has a strong focus on STEM education and workforce development. BallCODE addresses the engagement problem in STEM education, especially for underrepresented groups—which aligns with IBM's diversity and inclusion goals. Plus, our data platform creates opportunities for Watson integration, SkillsBuild connections, and research partnerships. This isn't just another educational tool—it's a strategic platform that enhances IBM's existing initiatives while creating new opportunities."
