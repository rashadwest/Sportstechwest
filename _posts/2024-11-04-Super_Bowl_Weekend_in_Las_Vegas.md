### Unforgettable Connections with NFL Legends
Super Bowl weekend in Las Vegas was unforgettable—not just because of the big game but for the incredible networking opportunities and meaningful connections it brought. A highlight was spending time with NFL legends [Ray Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Lewis) and [Charles Woodson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Woodson) at **Eight**, the upscale cigar lounge at [Resorts World Las Vegas](https://www.rwlasvegas.com/). Sharing that space with two athletes I’ve admired for years and connecting with them on a personal level was truly surreal.

### Reconnecting with Mitch Richmond
I also caught up with [Mitch Richmond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Richmond), a conversation that reminded me of my journey. Mitch and I originally met on a flight from San Francisco to [NBA Summer League](https://www.nba.com/summer-league), and he’s always been easy to talk to, with a real understanding of my mission.

### My First Pitch on Data Equity
In the midst of the weekend’s events, I had my first pitch with [Jessica Gilman](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/jessica-gilman) from [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), presenting my work in **data equity**. Sharing my vision with someone from such a respected institution was a significant milestone, and I valued her insights and feedback.

### Meeting with Sports Technology Investors
Super Bowl weekend also brought together investors from various industries, allowing me to make new connections with those who see potential in **sports technology**.

### Quality Time with Friends from Hampton University
I spent quality time with good friends from [Hampton University](https://home.hamptonu.edu/), including my former teammate Jeff Granger and Chad Easterling. The weekend was a perfect mix of business and personal moments, filled with unforgettable events.

### Memorable Events Hosted Across Las Vegas
I attended gatherings hosted by **The Players Impact Group**, [Lawrence Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Taylor)'s camp event, and pitch sessions at **WeWork** and other venues across Las Vegas. From [Marshawn Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshawn_Lynch) and [Too Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Short)’s event to the high energy at each pitch, the entire weekend was packed with inspiration and connection.

### Reflecting on the 49ers and Future Goals
The only downside? My childhood team, the [San Francisco 49ers](https://www.49ers.com/), didn’t make it to the game. Although I didn’t attend this year’s Super Bowl, I’m already setting my sights on going next year, fully inspired and ready to take on new goals. This weekend reminded me just how powerful connections and experiences can be, pushing me forward in both life and work.
