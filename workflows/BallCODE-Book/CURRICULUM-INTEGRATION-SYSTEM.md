## 🎯 THE GOAL

**Success Metric:** "Me being able to go to a clean website, read the book, see what I learned, go and play the game and the curriculum guides me to the next book to go to in order to continue the lessons and it repeats the process."

**The Complete Learning Loop:**
```
Website → Book → Game → Curriculum → Next Book → (Repeat)
```
