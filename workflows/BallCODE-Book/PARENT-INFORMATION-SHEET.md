## 🎯 WHAT IS BALLCODE?

**BallCODE teaches Python programming through engaging basketball stories.**

Your child will learn real coding skills (Python programming) while reading exciting basketball adventures. We use basketball to make coding concepts easy to understand and fun to learn.

**The Big Idea:** Kids already understand basketball—the rules, the strategies, the decision-making. So we use that knowledge to teach them how to code.

## 🎮 HOW DOES IT WORK?

### Three-Phase Learning Pathway

**Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)**
- Your child learns coding using basketball terms
- Drag blocks together (no typing required)
- See immediate results in game exercises

**Phase 2: Transition Bridge**
- Your child sees how blocks connect to code
- Understand that blocks = real code
- Build confidence for writing code

**Phase 3: Python Learning**
- Your child writes real Python code
- Same concepts, now in professional code
- Creates real programs that work

---

## 🏀 WHY BASKETBALL?

**Basketball is the framework, Python is what students learn.**

- **70% Story, 30% Skill:** Your child reads engaging basketball stories where coding concepts naturally appear
- **Familiar Context:** Kids already understand basketball, so learning feels natural
- **Real Application:** Students see how coding solves real basketball problems
- **Engaging:** Stories keep students interested while building real skills

**Example:** Instead of "Today we're learning about conditionals," students read a story about a player making decisions during a game, and the coding concept emerges naturally from the story.
