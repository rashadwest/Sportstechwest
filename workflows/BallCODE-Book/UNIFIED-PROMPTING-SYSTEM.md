# Unified Prompting System
## The Complete Framework for Better AI Results

**Combines:**
- **Greg Brockman's o1 Framework** (Goals, Format, Guardrails, Context)
- **CLEAR Framework** (Clarity, Logic, Examples, Adaptation, Results)
- **Alpha Evolve** (Systematic Deep Learning)

---

## 🎯 THE UNIFIED FRAMEWORK

### **1. GOAL (Brockman) + CLARITY (CLEAR)**
**What do you want? Be specific.**

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What exactly am I trying to achieve?
- What does success look like?
- What are the constraints or limitations?
- Who is the audience?
- What format is needed?

### **2. FORMAT (Brockman) + LOGIC (CLEAR)**
**Define the structure you want back.**

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What structure do I need? (List, table, script, outline, code, document?)
- What's the logical flow or sequence?
- How should this be organized?
- What steps should be followed?
- How does this build on previous work?

### **3. GUARDRAILS (Brockman) + ADAPTATION (CLEAR)**
**Set rules for accuracy and tone.**

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What accuracy standards are required?
- What tone/style should be used?
- What should be avoided?
- What constraints exist?
- What flexibility is needed?
- What might go wrong?

### **4. CONTEXT (Brockman) + EXAMPLES (CLEAR) + ALPHA EVOLVE**
**Provide background, goals, audience, and build systematically.**

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What background information is relevant?
- What are my goals and objectives?
- Who is the audience?
- What examples illustrate what I want?
- What similar work exists to reference?
- What foundational concepts need to be established first? (Layer 1)
- How should this build systematically? (Layers 2, 3, 4...)
- What systems thinking is needed?

### **5. RESULTS (CLEAR)**
**Define measurable outcomes.**

**Questions to Ask Yourself:**
- What does "done" look like?
- How will I know it's successful?
- What are the success criteria?
- What metrics matter?

## 💡 EXAMPLE: Using the Unified Framework

**Before (Vague):**
> "Help me write a blog post about AI"

**After (Using Unified Framework):**

```
## UNIFIED PROMPTING FRAMEWORK

### 1. GOAL & CLARITY
- What I want: A 1,200-word blog post explaining how AI can help small businesses automate customer service
- Success looks like: Clear, actionable guide that small business owners can implement
- Constraints: Must be beginner-friendly, no technical jargon
- Audience: Small business owners (non-technical)

### 2. FORMAT & LOGIC
- Structure needed: Blog post with introduction, 3 main sections, conclusion, and call-to-action
- Logical flow: Problem → Solution → Implementation → Benefits
- Steps to follow: Hook → Explain problem → Show AI solution → Give examples → Action steps

### 3. GUARDRAILS & ADAPTATION
- Accuracy standards: Must cite real tools and use accurate pricing
- Tone/style: Friendly, conversational, encouraging (not salesy)
- Avoid: Technical jargon, overwhelming details, false promises
- Flexibility: Can adjust length if needed, examples can vary

### 4. CONTEXT, EXAMPLES & ALPHA EVOLVE
- Background: Small businesses struggle with 24/7 customer service, AI chatbots can help
- Goals: Educate and inspire action, not just inform
- Examples: Reference specific tools like Intercom, Zendesk, or ChatGPT
- References: Follow structure of my previous blog post "5 Ways to Automate Your Business"
- Layer 1 (Foundation): Start with understanding the problem (customer service pain points)
- Layers 2+ (Build): Then introduce AI concept → Show specific tools → Give implementation steps
- Systems thinking: Connect customer service → AI tools → Business outcomes → ROI

### 5. RESULTS
- Done looks like: Complete blog post, ready to publish, with clear sections
- Success metrics: Reader can understand and take action, engaging tone, no technical barriers
- Quality standards: Professional, helpful, actionable, well-structured

---

Please write a 1,200-word blog post about how AI can help small businesses automate customer service. Make it beginner-friendly with real examples and actionable steps.
```

## 🎯 BEST PRACTICES

### ✅ DO:
1. **Always fill out the framework first** - Don't skip this step
2. **Be specific** - Vague goals = vague results
3. **Provide examples** - Show what you want, don't just describe
4. **Think in layers** - Build systematically (Alpha Evolve)
5. **Define success** - Know what "done" looks like
6. **Set guardrails** - Prevent unwanted outputs

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Skip the framework** - It saves time in the long run
2. **Be vague** - "Make it better" doesn't help
3. **Forget context** - AI needs background to perform well
4. **Ignore format** - Structure matters for o1 models
5. **Skip guardrails** - Without rules, AI makes assumptions

---

## 🔄 WHEN TO USE

### **Full Framework (23 Questions):**
- Complex tasks requiring multiple steps
- New work or projects
- Important deliverables
- Tasks with unclear requirements

## 🚀 GETTING STARTED

1. **Start with the Quick Template** - Copy it and use it for your next 5 prompts
2. **Refine based on results** - See what works, adjust what doesn't
3. **Build the habit** - Use it consistently for 2 weeks
4. **Scale up** - Once comfortable, integrate with AI assistant
