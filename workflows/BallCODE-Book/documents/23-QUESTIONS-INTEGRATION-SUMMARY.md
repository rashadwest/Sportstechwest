### The 4 Principles

1. **Principle 1: Always Invite AI to the Table**
   - Experiment in every prompt
   - Look for novel solutions
   - Create new concepts
   - Maintain project integrity

2. **Principle 2: Be the Human in the Loop**
   - Ask for human input on emotion, strategy, story content
   - Human writes all story content
   - Human makes strategic decisions
   - Human reviews all outputs

3. **Principle 3: Treat AI like a Person (Expert Persona)**
   - Embody AIMCODE experts (Zhang, Resnick, Reggio, Hassabis, Jobs)
   - Apply expert methodologies
   - Use expert perspectives

4. **Principle 4: Assume Worst AI (Always Improve)**
   - Always look for better solutions
   - Question current approaches
   - Research improvements
   - Optimize continuously
