    - Block 1: Receive outlet pass
    - Block 2: Dribble to half-court
    - Block 3: Pass to wing
    - Block 4: Drive to basket
  - Create a loop: `repeat(sequence, 5)` - run this sequence 5 times
  - Show the code structure: `for i in range(5): execute_fast_break()`
- **Struggle:** Understanding that loops repeat the SAME sequence each time
- **Learning:** Loops make repetitive actions consistent and reliable

#### Act III: Resolution and Application
- **Application:** Team uses loop structure to execute fast break 5 times perfectly
- **Basketball Success:** Consistent execution leads to 5 successful fast breaks
- **Connection:** "Loops help us repeat actions perfectly every time"

**Game Integration:**
- **Block Coding Mode:** Students drag blocks to create loop structure
  ```
  [START]
  [REPEAT 5 TIMES]
    [BLOCK 1: Receive Pass]
    [BLOCK 2: Dribble Forward]

    [BLOCK 4: Drive to Basket]
  [END LOOP]
  [END]
  ```

  - Option 3: Layup (70% chance, worth 2 points)
- **Basketball Need:** "Which shot gives us the best chance to win?"
- **Math Concept Hint:** "We need to calculate which option is best"

#### Act II: Learning and Struggle (Math Emerges)
- **Basketball Challenge Intensifies:** Time running out, need to decide
- **Math Concept Emerges:** WatsonX calculates Expected Value (EV) for each option
- **How It Works:**
  - **Expected Value Formula:** EV = (Probability × Points) - (Miss Probability × 0)
  - **Option 1 (3-pointer):** EV = 0.30 × 3 = 0.9 points
  - **Option 2 (Mid-range):** EV = 0.50 × 2 = 1.0 points
  - **Option 3 (Layup):** EV = 0.70 × 2 = 1.4 points

- **Struggle:** Understanding that higher percentage doesn't always mean better (3-pointer has lower percentage but more points)
- **Learning:** Math helps us make optimal decisions under pressure

#### Act III: Resolution and Application
