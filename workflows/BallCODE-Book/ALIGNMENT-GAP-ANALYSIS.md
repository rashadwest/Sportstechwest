## 🔍 DETAILED GAP ANALYSIS

### 1. Syllabus ↔ Website

**Current State:**
- Syllabus exists for grades 3-8
- Website shows books but doesn't show syllabus structure
- No clear connection between syllabus and website content

**Gap:**
- Website doesn't have "For Schools" section
- Syllabus isn't downloadable from website
- No visual representation of course structure

**Fix:**
- Add "For Schools" section to website
- Include downloadable syllabus PDF
- Show course structure visually
- Link syllabus to books and game

---

### 2. Professional Development ↔ Game

**Current State:**
- PD guide exists (30-45 minutes)
- PD references block coding game
- PD doesn't mention Python mode (because it doesn't exist)

**Gap:**
- PD doesn't show Python progression
- No training on Python mode
- No guidance on when to transition from blocks to Python

**Fix:**
- Update PD guide with Python section
- Add Python mode training materials
- Create transition guide (blocks → Python)
- Add Python troubleshooting section

---

### 3. Curriculum ↔ Python Game

**Current State:**
- Curriculum describes three-phase progression
- Phase 3 is "Python Learning"
- Python game mode doesn't exist yet

**Gap:**
- Curriculum promises Python but game doesn't deliver
- No Python exercises in game
- Students can't practice Python as described

**Fix:**
- Implement Python game mode (in progress)
- Create Python exercises for each book
- Align exercises with curriculum objectives
- Add Python assessment rubrics

---

### 4. Books ↔ Python Game

**Current State:**
- Books teach Python concepts
- Books reference Python code examples
- Python game mode doesn't exist to practice

**Gap:**
- Books show Python but students can't practice
- No connection from book Python examples to game
- Missing "Try in Python Game" links

**Fix:**
- Add Python exercises to each book chapter
- Create book-to-Python-game links
- Show Python code examples that work in game
- Add "Practice in Python Game" buttons

---

### 5. Website ↔ Python Game

**Current State:**
- Website shows books and curriculum
- Website links to block coding game
- Website doesn't mention Python game mode

**Gap:**
- No Python mode showcase on website
- No visual learning pathway (blocks → Python)
- Missing Python demo or video

**Fix:**
- Add Python mode showcase section
- Create visual learning pathway diagram
- Add Python mode demo video
- Show side-by-side: blocks vs. Python

---

### 6. Block Coding Game ↔ Python Game

**Current State:**
- Block coding game works well
- Python game mode doesn't exist
- No bridge between blocks and Python

**Gap:**
- No way to transition from blocks to Python
- No side-by-side comparison view
- Missing block-to-Python conversion feature

**Fix:**
- Implement Python game mode (in progress)
- Create block-to-Python bridge view
- Add "Convert blocks to Python" feature
- Show Python equivalent of block code
