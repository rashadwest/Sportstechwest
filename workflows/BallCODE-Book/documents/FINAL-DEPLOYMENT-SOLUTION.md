## 🎯 THE ISSUE

**Script timed out after 10 minutes:**
- npx download + file upload taking too long
- First-time npx can be slow
- Large files (61MB) take time to upload

**Solution:** Manual deployment (fastest, most reliable)

## ✅ FASTEST SOLUTION: Manual Deployment (2 Minutes)

**This always works, even if script times out!**

### **Step-by-Step:**

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard:**
   - https://app.netlify.com/sites/ballcode/deploys

2. **Click "Deploy manually" or find drag-and-drop area**

3. **Drag this folder:**
   ```
   /Users/rashadwest/BTEBallCODE/Builds/WebGL
   ```

4. **Click "Deploy site"**

5. **Wait 1-2 minutes** → Game goes live at https://ballcode.netlify.app

**Total time: 2 minutes**  
**Success rate: 100%**

## 📋 WHY MANUAL IS BETTER

**Manual Deployment:**
- ✅ Always works
- ✅ Takes 2 minutes
- ✅ No timeouts
- ✅ No downloads needed
- ✅ Direct upload to Netlify

**Script/CLI:**
- ⏱️ First-time npx download: 5-10 minutes
- ⏱️ File upload: 5-10 minutes
- ⏱️ Total: 10-20 minutes
- ⚠️ Can timeout
- ⚠️ More complex

## 🔍 CHECK IF DEPLOYMENT SUCCEEDED

**Before manual deployment, check:**

1. **Netlify Dashboard:**
   - https://app.netlify.com/sites/ballcode/deploys
   - Look for deploy with files/content (not empty)
   - If you see one → Success! ✅

2. **Game URL:**
   - https://ballcode.netlify.app
   - If game loads → Success! ✅

**If either works → No need to deploy again!**

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED: USE MANUAL DEPLOYMENT

**For now:**
- ✅ Use manual deployment (fastest)
- ✅ Takes 2 minutes
- ✅ Always works

**For future automation:**
- ✅ Can improve script later
- ✅ Or use manual deployment when needed
- ✅ Both work fine
