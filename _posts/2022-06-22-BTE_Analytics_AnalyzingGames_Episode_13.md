# Analyzing Games

We will have developed our own way to make analytics cool by using our system and having fun commentating games.

1. We create the highlight video of the player.

2. We create our analysis for the game.

3. We add the DribbleTree metrics to the highlight footage.

4. We upload the video to YouTube and other social media outlets.

This is an example of the first BTE game analysis we have created below.
