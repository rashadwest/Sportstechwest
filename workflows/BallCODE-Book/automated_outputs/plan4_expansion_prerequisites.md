# Plan 4: Expansion Prerequisites

**Before starting Episodes 2-12, ensure these are complete:**

---

## Foundation Requirements

### Episode 1 MVP Must Be 100% Complete

**Current Status:** 45% complete

**Required Before Expansion:**
- [ ] Story written and finalized (80% → 100%)
- [ ] Skill Pit-Stop polished (90% → 100%)
- [ ] Exercises tested (90% → 100%)
- [ ] Visual assets created (30% → 100%) ⚠️ **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
- [ ] Visuals integrated into document
- [ ] Production PDFs created (40% → 100%)
- [ ] QR codes generated
- [ ] Beta testing completed with feedback incorporated
- [ ] Unity integration functional (optional but recommended)

**Why:** Episode 1 serves as the template and proof of concept for Episodes 2-12. Completing it validates the approach and creates a repeatable process.

---

## Validation Requirements

### Pilot Program Validation

**Required:**
- [ ] Episode 1 deployed to pilot school(s)
- [ ] Initial feedback collected (minimum 2-3 schools)
- [ ] Learning outcomes validated
- [ ] Teacher feedback incorporated
- [ ] Student engagement confirmed

**Why:** Expansion should be based on validated learning outcomes, not assumptions.

---

## Process Requirements

### Production Template Established

**Required:**
- [ ] Episode 1 production process documented
- [ ] Time estimates validated (actual vs. planned)
- [ ] Cost estimates validated
- [ ] Quality standards established
- [ ] Review process defined

**Why:** Episodes 2-12 should follow a proven, efficient process.

---

## Resource Requirements

### Visual Asset Pipeline

**Required:**
- [ ] Visual generation process established (automated or manual)
- [ ] Style guide finalized
- [ ] Asset integration workflow defined
- [ ] Quality control process in place

**Why:** Visual assets are a major component and need consistent process.

### Content Creation Pipeline

**Required:**
- [ ] Story writing process documented
- [ ] Exercise creation process documented
- [ ] Skill Pit-Stop creation process documented
- [ ] Review and editing process defined

**Why:** Consistent quality requires consistent processes.

---

## Technical Requirements

### Unity Integration (If Applicable)

**Required:**
- [ ] Episode 1 Unity integration complete
- [ ] Integration process documented
- [ ] Testing process established
- [ ] Deployment process defined

**Why:** Technical integration should be proven before scaling.

---

## Business Requirements

### Market Validation

**Required:**
- [ ] Pilot program feedback positive
- [ ] Teacher adoption confirmed
- [ ] Student engagement confirmed
- [ ] Learning outcomes validated
- [ ] Scalability confirmed

**Why:** Expansion should be based on proven demand and effectiveness.

## Recommended Sequence

### Phase 1: Complete Episode 1 (Current)
- Finish remaining 55%
- Validate with pilots
- Document process

### Phase 2: Validate Approach (2-3 months)
- Run pilot programs
- Collect feedback
- Refine process

### Phase 3: Begin Expansion (After validation)
- Start Episodes 2-3
- Use Episode 1 as template
- Iterate based on learnings

### Phase 4: Scale Production (After Episodes 2-3)
- Produce Episodes 4-12
- Optimize process
- Maintain quality

## Current Status Check

**Foundation:** ⚠️ 45% complete (needs completion)  
**Validation:** ❌ Not started (needs Episode 1 completion first)  
**Process:** ⚠️ Partially documented (needs Episode 1 completion)  
**Resources:** ⚠️ Partially ready (visual pipeline needs completion)  
**Technical:** ⚠️ 50% complete (specs ready, implementation pending)  
**Business:** ❌ Not validated (needs pilot programs)

---

## Recommendation

**DO NOT start Episodes 2-12 until:**
1. Episode 1 is 100% complete
2. Episode 1 is validated with at least 2-3 pilot schools
3. Production process is documented and proven
4. Visual asset pipeline is established

**Focus now:** Complete Episode 1 MVP (remaining 55%)

---

**Status:** ✅ Prerequisites defined  
**Action:** Complete Episode 1 before expansion
