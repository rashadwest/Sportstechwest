## 🎯 WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO (Simple Version)

**The Problem:**
- Your game needs to build on GitHub (like a robot building your game)
- The robot needs permission from Unity to build
- We need to give the robot a "password" (license) so it can build

**The Solution:**
- Get a license number from Unity
- Put it in GitHub (like putting a password in a safe)
- The robot can then build your game

---

## ✅ WHAT YOU DID (Good!)

**You contacted Unity support** - That's perfect! They will help you get the license number.

**What Unity support will give you:**
- A license number (looks like: `1234-5678-9012-3456-7890-1234`)
- OR instructions on how to get it

---

## 📋 WHAT TO DO WHEN UNITY SUPPORT RESPONDS

### **Step 1: Get the License Number**

**Unity support will give you ONE of these:**

**Option A: They give you a serial number**
- It looks like: `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`
- Copy it exactly as they give it to you

**Option B: They give you a license file**
- It's a file that ends in `.ulf`
- Download it
- Open it in TextEdit
- Copy everything inside

**Option C: They tell you how to get it**
- Follow their instructions
- Get the number or file
- Then come back here

### **Step 2: Put It in GitHub (Like Putting a Password in a Safe)**

**This is like putting a password in a safe so the robot can use it:**

1. **Go to this website:**
   ```
   https://github.com/rashadwest/BTEBallCODE/settings/secrets/actions
   ```
   (I'll open this for you)

2. **Click the green button that says "New repository secret"**

3. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Name:** Type: `UNITY_SERIAL` (if you got a number)
     - OR Type: `UNITY_LICENSE` (if you got a file)
   - **Secret:** Paste the number or file contents here

4. **Click "Add secret"**

5. **Done!** The robot now has the password!

### **Step 3: Tell Me When You're Done**

**After you add the secret:**
- Tell me: "I added the license to GitHub"
- I'll push the workflow update
- The robot will try to build your game
- We'll see if it works!
