## 📐 STORY STRUCTURE (3 Acts)

### ACT I: The Reactive Defender (~400-500 words)

**Opening Scene:**
- One-on-one situation
- Defender reacts instantly to every move Nova makes
- Nova tries simple fakes (one fake left, one fake right)
- Defender doesn't fall for them - reads every move immediately

**Main Conflict:**
- Simple, single fakes don't work
- Defender is too quick, too reactive
- Every attempt to get past fails
- Nova is frustrated

**Character Introduction:**
- **Nova:** Frustrated, simple fakes don't work
- **Arc:** Detects problem: "Pattern repetition missing. No loop structure."
- **Coach Circuit:** Provides wisdom: "Create a pattern, then break it. That's how loops work—repeat, then change."

**Inciting Incident:**
- After multiple failed attempts, Nova realizes: "Maybe I need to repeat, then break the pattern?"

**End Act I:** Nova decides to learn pattern creation and loop structures

---

### ACT II: The Pattern Loop (~400-500 words)

**Rising Action:**
- Defender gets better at reading single moves
- Every fake is anticipated
- Time is running out

**Learning Moment:**
- Nova practices the in & out dribble
- Learns to create a pattern first: "Fake left (repeat), fake left (repeat), fake left (repeat), then go right (break)"
- Begins to see it as a loop structure

**Concept Introduction:**
- **AI Concept:** Pattern Recognition and Loop Detection
  - Arc: "Fake left, fake left, fake left—then go right. That's a loop."
  - Pattern recognition shows that repeating patterns create expectation
  - Breaking patterns creates surprise

- **Math Concept:** Sequences and Patterns
  - "Fake left, fake left, fake left, then go right."
  - Pattern recognition: "What pattern creates the best deception?"
  - Basic sequences: "Repeat 3 times, then break."

- **Coding Concept:** Loops and Repetition
  - "REPEAT [fake left] 3 TIMES, THEN [go right]."
  - Loops repeat actions until a condition is met
  - Breaking loops at the right moment

**Struggle:**
- Nova initially resists: "Why repeat? Just go the direction I want!"
- Coach Circuit explains: "Patterns create expectation. Breaking them creates opportunity."
- Through practice, it clicks: "Oh, loops repeat patterns, then break them!"

**Turning Point:**
- Nova realizes that creating patterns and breaking them is the key
- She sees the connection between deception and coding's loop structures

**End Act II:** Nova understands loop structures and pattern creation

---

### ACT III: Breaking the Loop (~400-500 words)

**Climax:**
- Final seconds, need to get past defender
- This is the moment of truth
- Opportunity will be lost if she fails

**Solution:**
- Nova uses a loop pattern: REPEAT [fake left] 3 TIMES, THEN [go right]
- She creates the pattern, builds expectation, then breaks it at the perfect moment

**Basketball Success:**
- The defender falls for the pattern!
- After seeing three fakes left, the defender commits
- Nova breaks the loop by going right
- She gets past and creates a scoring opportunity

**Resolution:**
- Nova understands that loops create patterns, then break them
- The team scores
- Nova reflects: "Loops work! Repeat the pattern, then break it!"

**Connection Made:**
- Nova makes the clear connection: "Coding uses loops to repeat patterns, just like deception. Create expectation, then break it at the perfect moment."

**End Act III:** Nova succeeds using loop patterns, understands loops in coding

## 🧩 EMBEDDED MICRO-EXERCISES (IN-BOOK) + 🎮 GAME DRILL LINKS

**Purpose:** Put quick “do it now” coding checks *inside* the story so Book 3 flows: **Story → Micro Exercise → Game Drill → Back to Story**.

### Standard Exercise Block (repeat this format)
- **StoryBeat:** What just happened in the story (1–3 paragraphs)
- **SkillSpotlight:** One concept (loops / repetition / breaking pattern)
- **MicroExercise_InBook:** 30–120 second activity
- **GameDrill_Link:** The matching drill in the game

### ID conventions (stable + reusable across books)
- **Book micro-exercise ID:** `B3-A{act}-S{scene}-E{num}` (example: `B3-A2-S1-E2`)
- **Game drill ID:** `G-B3-A{act}-S{scene}-D{num}` (example: `G-B3-A2-S1-D1`)

### Base Game URL (Book 3 exercise)
- `ballcode.co/play?book=3&exercise=deception-loop&source=book`
- **Note:** For now, all drills route to the same Book 3 exercise and can be implemented as **steps/variants** inside it (e.g., `&step=1`).
