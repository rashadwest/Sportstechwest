---

### 3. Updated Episode 1 Teacher Guide
**File:** `Episode-1-Teacher-Guide.md`

**New Section Added:**
- "Literacy Learning Objectives" section
- Explicit AI, Math, and Coding objectives for grades 3-5 and 6-8
- Evidence in episode for each objective
- Integration explanation

**Use When:**
- Teaching Episode 1
- Understanding what students learn
- Assessing student progress
- Planning lessons

---

## Key Concepts

### Three Literacies Defined

1. **AI Literacy:** Understanding, interacting with, and critically evaluating AI systems
2. **Math Literacy:** Applying mathematical concepts to solve real-world problems
3. **Coding Literacy:** Understanding and writing code, applying computational thinking

### Integration Principle

**Basketball is the framework, but AI + Math + Coding are what students learn.**

- Basketball = Engaging narrative vehicle
- AI + Math + Coding = Actual learning objectives
- All three taught together, not separately

---

## Implementation Checklist

### For Each Episode

**Content Development:**
- [ ] AI literacy objectives defined (grades 3-5 and 6-8)
- [ ] Math literacy objectives defined (grades 3-5 and 6-8)
- [ ] Coding literacy objectives defined (grades 3-5 and 6-8)
- [ ] Story integrates all three literacies
- [ ] Skill Pit-Stop explicitly teaches all three
- [ ] Exercises practice all three literacies
- [ ] Assessment measures all three literacies

**Teacher Resources:**
- [ ] Teacher guide includes literacy objectives
- [ ] Assessment rubrics for each literacy
- [ ] Evidence in episode documented
- [ ] Research sources referenced

## Quick Reference: Episode 1 Example

### AI Literacy (Grades 3-5)
- AI can "see" and detect changes
- AI asks for human confirmation
- Confidence scores indicate certainty

**Evidence:** Arc detects state shifts, asks for confirmation, provides confidence scores

### Math Literacy (Grades 3-5)
- Count possessions and turnovers
- Calculate simple statistics
- Use numbers to make decisions

**Evidence:** "Three possessions, two turnovers, zero points"

### Coding Literacy (Grades 3-5)
- Identify four states
- Understand state transitions
- Apply state concepts

**Evidence:** Four states defined, transitions shown, applied to solve problem

## How to Use This System

### For Curriculum Developers

1. **Start with Strategy Document**
   - Read `Literacy-Integration-Strategy.md`
   - Understand the framework
   - Review learning objectives

2. **Reference Research Sources**
   - Check `Research-Sources/` for citations
   - Understand research backing
   - Cite sources in materials

3. **Apply to Episodes**
   - Define literacy objectives for each episode
   - Integrate all three literacies
   - Document evidence in episode

4. **Create Teacher Resources**
   - Include literacy objectives in teacher guides
   - Provide assessment rubrics
   - Reference research sources

### For Teachers

1. **Review Literacy Objectives**
   - Read the "Literacy Learning Objectives" section
   - Understand what students will learn
   - Note grade-level differences (3-5 vs 6-8)

2. **Plan Instruction**
   - Identify where each literacy appears in story
   - Prepare to explicitly teach each literacy
   - Plan assessment for each literacy

3. **Assess Learning**
   - Use rubrics to assess each literacy
   - Check evidence of learning
   - Provide feedback on all three literacies

4. **Reference Research**
   - Understand "why" behind approach
   - Share with parents/administrators
