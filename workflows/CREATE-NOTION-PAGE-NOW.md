Use Notion MCP to create a new page in the Blog Posts database with these properties:

Title: "Why I Built a Local Server to Run 24/7"
Status: Draft
Date: 2025-10-29
Description: "Why I decided to build my own always-on infrastructure for automation, AI workflows, and continuous learning — and why it changed everything."
Tags: server, automation, docker, 24/7, local, infrastructure, mcp
Categories: Insights
Author: Rashad West
Thumbnail: /assets/images/blog-img/24-7-server-hero.png

Then read the file workflows/local-server-24-7-blog-content.md and add all the content to this Notion page, formatting it properly with:
- Front Matter section as a collapsible toggle
- Blog Content sections with proper headers (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
- Image Prompts section with all 4 image prompts
- Social Media Excerpts section with Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram excerpts
- Status checklist

After creating the page and adding all content, give me the Notion page URL/link.
