## 🔄 ITERATION CYCLE

### Cycle 1: Initial Pass
```
Analysis → Design → Validation → Refinement → Decision
```

**Expected Outcome:**

```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Better alignment
- Minor gaps addressed
- Design refined

### Cycle 3: Final Pass (if needed)
```
Final Analysis → Final Design → Validation → Final Refinement → Proceed
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Full alignment

## 🚀 EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATION

### When to Iterate:
- **High Uncertainty:** Many unknowns → Iterate more
- **High Complexity:** Complex system → Iterate more
- **High Stakes:** Critical feature → Iterate more
- **Low Time:** Time pressure → Iterate less

### Iteration Guidelines:
- **Simple Tasks:** 1 iteration (initial pass)
- **Medium Tasks:** 2 iterations (initial + refinement)
- **Complex Tasks:** 3+ iterations (as needed)

### Time Allocation:
- **Initial Pass:** 70% of time
- **Refinement Pass:** 20% of time
- **Final Pass:** 10% of time

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

### Iteration Effectiveness:
- **Convergence Rate:** How quickly analysis and design align
- **Quality Improvement:** How much quality improves per iteration
- **Time Efficiency:** Time spent vs. quality gained

### Target Metrics:
- **Convergence:** 2-3 iterations for most tasks
- **Quality:** 80%+ quality after 2 iterations
- **Efficiency:** <20% additional time for iterations

## 📝 NOTES

**Key Principles:**
1. **Analysis informs design** - Design based on analysis
2. **Design validates analysis** - Design reveals analysis gaps
3. **Iteration improves both** - Both improve through iteration
4. **Convergence is goal** - Alignment is success

**Best Practices:**
- Start with prioritized questions
- Document insights clearly
- Validate early and often
- Refine based on validation
- Iterate until convergence
