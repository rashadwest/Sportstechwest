# Quick Guide: Describing Game Images

**Copyright © 2025 Rashad West. All Rights Reserved.**

**Purpose:** Simple guide to describe game screenshots for documentation  
**Time:** ~5-10 minutes per image

## 🎯 What You Need to Describe

For each game image, answer these questions:

### 1. **What Level Is This?**
- Level name/number (e.g., "Watson1 Level 3", "Foundation Block Tutorial")
- Difficulty level (Tutorial/Intermediate/Advanced)

### 2. **What's the Objective?**
- What is the player trying to do? (e.g., "Move to the basket", "Dribble past defenders")
- What makes this level unique?

### 3. **What Do You See?**
- **Court layout:** Basketball court, hoops, lines, obstacles
- **Player position:** Where is the player/ball?
- **UI elements:** Buttons, menus, score, timer
- **Block coding area:** What blocks are visible? What's arranged?
- **Game state:** Is it running? Paused? Success screen? Failure screen?

### 4. **What Coding Concept?**
- What coding skill is being taught? (e.g., "If/Then statements", "Loops", "Variables")
- How does the basketball context relate to the coding concept?

## 📝 Quick Template (Copy for Each Image)

```
**Image:** [filename.png]
**Level:** [Level name/number]
**Objective:** [What player needs to do]
**Coding Concept:** [What's being taught]

**What I See:**
- Court: [Describe court layout]
- Player: [Where is player/ball?]
- Blocks: [What blocks are visible/arranged?]
- UI: [Buttons, menus, etc.]
- State: [Running/Paused/Success/Failure]

**Key Details:**
[Any important mechanics or features]
```

## 🎮 Example Description

```
**Image:** Screenshot-2025-11-07-1.41.44-PM.png
**Level:** Watson1 - Tutorial Level 1
**Objective:** Move the player to the basket using basic movement blocks
**Coding Concept:** Sequential execution (blocks run in order)

**What I See:**
- Court: Standard basketball court with one basket visible on the right
- Player: Small character sprite in the center-left of the court
- Blocks: "Move Forward" block in the coding area, connected to "Start" block
- UI: "Run" button visible, block palette on left side
- State: Paused/Ready to run

**Key Details:**
- First tutorial level - very simple
- Only one block needed to complete
- Teaches that blocks execute in order from top to bottom
```

## 🚀 Quick Workflow

1. **Open the image** (in Finder or image viewer)
2. **Fill in the template** above (5-10 minutes)
3. **Save descriptions** in a document (e.g., `Game-Image-Descriptions.md`)
4. **Repeat for each image**

## 📁 Where Are Your Game Images?

Based on your project, images are likely in:
- `My Books/BallCODE_Watson1/` (Tutorial levels)
- `My Books/BallCODE_Watson2/` (Intermediate levels)
- `My Books/BallCODE_CiscoIQ/` (Advanced levels)
- `BallCODE Strategy Game/` (Strategy game screenshots)

## 💡 Tips for Low-Focus Work

**Since you're in a low-focus window:**

1. **Do 2-3 images at a time** - Don't try to do all at once
2. **Focus on basics** - Level name, objective, what you see
3. **Skip details** - You can add more detail later
4. **Use voice notes** - If typing is too much, record voice descriptions
5. **Set a timer** - 10 minutes per image, then take a break

## 🎯 For Tomorrow's Development

**What the developer needs:**
- Level names/numbers
- What each level teaches
- How levels progress
- Any special mechanics

**You don't need:**
- Perfect descriptions
- Every detail
- Professional documentation (yet)

**Goal:** Enough info so developer knows what each image represents.

## ✅ Quick Checklist

For each image, make sure you have:
- [ ] Level name/number
- [ ] Objective (what player does)
- [ ] Coding concept (what's being taught)
- [ ] Basic visual description (court, player, blocks, UI)

That's it! Simple and fast.
