## 🚀 Deployment Method

**Your site is hosted on Netlify** (based on `ballcode.netlify.app` reference in your code).

### Auto-Deployment Status:
If your Netlify site is connected to the GitHub repository (`https://github.com/JuddCMelvin/BallCode.git`), it should **automatically deploy** within 1-5 minutes after the push.

1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Find your `ballcode` site
3. Check the "Deploys" tab
4. You should see a new deploy triggered by the GitHub push
5. Status should show "Published" when complete

### Option 2: Check Live Site
1. Visit `https://ballcode.netlify.app` (or `https://ballcode.co` if custom domain)
