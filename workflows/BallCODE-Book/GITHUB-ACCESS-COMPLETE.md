## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### 1. Test Push Access
I can now push changes to your repository. Let's test it:

**To test:**
```bash
# I'll make a small test change
# Then push to verify access works
```

### 2. Update Netlify Connection
Once we verify push works, update Netlify:

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Find your site (ballcode)
3. Site settings → Build & deploy
4. Update repository: `rashadwest/BallCode`
5. Save

### 3. Add Me as Collaborator (Optional)
If you want me to push directly:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/rashadwest/BallCode/settings/access`
2. Click "Add people"
3. Enter my GitHub username (I'll provide it)
4. Give "Write" access
5. Send invitation

## ✅ WHAT I CAN DO NOW

### With Your Fork:
- ✅ Read all code
- ✅ Make changes locally
- ✅ Commit changes
- ⚠️ Push changes (need to test - may need credentials)
- ✅ View repository
- ✅ Access all files

### Still Need:
- ⚠️ **Push access** - Need to test if credentials work
- ⚠️ **Netlify access** - To deploy changes
- ⚠️ **Unity project** - For game integration

---

## 🎯 TESTING PUSH ACCESS

Let me test if I can push to your repository:

**I'll:**
1. Make a small test change (or use existing commits)
2. Try to push
3. See if credentials are needed
4. Report back

**If push works:**
- ✅ Full access confirmed!
- ✅ Can deploy changes directly

**If push needs credentials:**
- We'll set up authentication
- OR you can push manually when I make changes
