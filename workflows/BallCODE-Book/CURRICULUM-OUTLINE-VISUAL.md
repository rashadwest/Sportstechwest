## 📚 THREE-PHASE PATHWAY

### Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)
```
Visual Blocks → Basketball Terms → No Typing Required
```

### Phase 2: Transition Bridge
```
Blocks = Code → Side-by-Side View → Pattern Recognition
```

### Phase 3: Python Learning
```
Real Python → Same Concepts → Programming Skills
```

---

## 📖 BOOK STRUCTURE

### Book 1: The Foundation Block
**Concept:** Sequences  
**Dribble:** Pound (Level 1)  
**Python:** Basic commands, sequences

### Book 2: The Code of Flow
**Concept:** Conditionals  
**Dribble:** Crossover (Level 2)  
**Python:** if/elif/else statements

### Book 3: The Pattern - UPDATED
**Concept:** Loops + **Data Analysis**  
**Dribble:** In & Out (Level 3)  
**Python:** for/while loops + **Data fetching, pattern analysis**

**NEW: Data Integration:**
- Fetch opponent data (simplified API)
- Analyze patterns using loops
- Use data to inform strategy

**Supplementary:** code-basketball-files repository
