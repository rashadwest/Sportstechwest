**Purpose:** Detailed descriptions for creating/commissioning visual assets for Episode 1

---

## Visual Asset 1: Court Map (Center Circle)

### Description
A basketball court diagram focused on the center circle area, showing the tip-off position and transition lanes. The court should be stylized to match the "Data Court" theme from the story, with subtle tech/code elements.

### Key Elements
- Full basketball court outline
- Center circle prominently featured
- Transition lanes marked (left lane, right lane, middle)
- Half-court line clearly visible
- Three-point arc visible
- Stylized to suggest "Data Court" - perhaps with subtle grid lines, code-like patterns, or digital aesthetic
- Color scheme: Traditional court colors (wood/tan) with blue accents to suggest tech theme

### Technical Specifications
- **Format:** Vector (SVG) or high-res raster (PNG)
- **Dimensions:** 1200x800px minimum (for digital), 300 DPI for print
- **Style:** Clean, modern, kid-friendly
- **Text Labels:** Optional - can add labels like "Center Circle", "Transition Lanes" if needed

### Reference
- Standard basketball court dimensions
- Center circle is 12 feet in diameter
- Should match the "Data Court" description from the story

### Glif Prompt
"Basketball court diagram showing center circle, transition lanes, and half-court line. Stylized with subtle tech/digital elements - grid lines, code-like patterns, blue accents. Clean, modern, kid-friendly illustration. Top-down view."

## Visual Asset 2: Shadow Press Scouts (Monster Art)

### Description
The Shadow Press Scouts are the antagonists of Episode 1. They should appear as dark, shifting, shadowy figures that create chaos and force turnovers. They should be menacing but not scary (age-appropriate for grades 3-8).

### Key Elements
- Dark, shadowy humanoid figures
- Shifting, blurry appearance (suggesting movement/chaos)
- Multiple figures (3-5 Scouts shown)
- Basketball-related elements (maybe holding basketballs, or basketball-shaped shadows)
- Tech/code aesthetic (perhaps code fragments visible in the shadows)
- Menacing but not terrifying (think "cool villain" not "horror movie")

### Character Design
- Height: Slightly taller than average players
- Silhouette: Lean, athletic, shadowy
- Features: Minimal facial features (maybe glowing eyes), shadowy form
- Movement: Should suggest speed and chaos
- Color: Primarily dark (blacks, dark grays, dark purples) with subtle blue/tech accents

### Technical Specifications
- **Format:** Vector (SVG) or high-res raster (PNG)
- **Dimensions:** 1200x1200px minimum (for digital), 300 DPI for print
- **Style:** Dark, shadowy, but kid-friendly
- **Transparency:** May need transparent background for overlays

### Reference
- Should match the description from the story: "dark, shifting shapes that seemed to blur the lines between players and code"
- Think "cool video game enemy" aesthetic
- Should contrast with the main crew (bright, clear, heroic)

### Glif Prompt
"Shadowy basketball players, dark shifting figures with tech/code elements visible in their shadows. Menacing but kid-friendly villains. Multiple figures (3-5) creating chaos on a basketball court. Dark colors (black, dark gray, dark purple) with subtle blue tech accents. Athletic, lean silhouettes. Cool video game enemy aesthetic, not scary."

## Visual Asset 3: State Diagram (Code Visualization)

### Description
A visual diagram showing the four states (START, LIVE, DEAD, OUTCOME) and how they transition. This should look like a flowchart or state machine diagram, but made kid-friendly and basketball-themed.

### Key Elements
- Four boxes/circles representing the four states:
  - START (beginning state)
  - LIVE (active state)
  - DEAD (paused state)
  - OUTCOME (end state)
- Arrows showing state transitions:
  - START → LIVE
  - LIVE → DEAD
  - DEAD → LIVE
  - LIVE → OUTCOME
  - DEAD → OUTCOME
  - OUTCOME → START (for next possession)
- Basketball-themed icons or illustrations in each state box
- Clear labels for each state
- Color coding (suggestions):
  - START: Yellow/Gold (beginning)
  - LIVE: Green (active, go!)
  - DEAD: Red (stopped)
  - OUTCOME: Blue (result)

### Layout Options
**Option 1: Linear Flow**
```
START → LIVE → DEAD → LIVE → OUTCOME
  ↑                        ↓
  └────────────────────────┘
```

**Option 2: Circular/Flowchart**
- START at top
- LIVE in middle
- DEAD below LIVE
- OUTCOME at bottom
- Arrows showing all possible transitions

### Technical Specifications
- **Format:** Vector (SVG) preferred for scalability
- **Dimensions:** 1000x800px minimum (for digital), 300 DPI for print
- **Style:** Clean, modern, educational
- **Text:** Clear, readable labels
- **Icons:** Simple basketball-themed icons (ball, player, whistle, scoreboard)

### Reference
- Standard state machine/flowchart design
- Should be educational but engaging
- Should match the explanation in Skill Pit-Stop

### Glif Prompt
"Flowchart diagram showing four basketball states: START, LIVE, DEAD, OUTCOME. Color-coded boxes with basketball icons. Arrows showing state transitions. Clean, educational, kid-friendly design. Modern flowchart aesthetic with basketball theme."
