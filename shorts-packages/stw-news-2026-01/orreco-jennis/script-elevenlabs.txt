An Olympic champion's app just became core infrastructure for pro women's sports.

This week, Orreco — the AI performance company backed by Mark Cuban, used by national teams and the WNBA — acquired Jennis. That's the women's health and performance app co-founded by heptathlon gold medalist Jessica Ennis-Hill.

Jennis was built around hormone-intelligent content: education and training for women athletes, partly from Ennis-Hill's own experience returning to competition after pregnancy.

Orreco already runs FitrWoman — used by the US and England women's soccer teams, USA Swimming, WNBA, and NWSL. Now Jennis's content gets woven into Orreco's dashboards: same ecosystem, one place for data and guidance.

So we're not just watching a startup get bought. We're watching one athlete's answer to "how do I come back?" become the backbone of how the best women's teams in the world prepare and recover.

That's STW News. More next time.
