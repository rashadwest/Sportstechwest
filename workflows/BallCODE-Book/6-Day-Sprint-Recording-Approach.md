## Parallel Work Strategy

### How We Work Together:

**You Record → I Integrate (Parallel Process)**
1. You record Episode 1 → Share with me
2. I integrate Career Connections while you record Episode 2
3. You record Episode 2 → Share with me
4. I integrate while you record Episode 3
5. Continue this pattern

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No waiting - work happens in parallel
- ✅ Faster overall completion
- ✅ I can prepare materials ahead of recordings
- ✅ You can record at your pace
