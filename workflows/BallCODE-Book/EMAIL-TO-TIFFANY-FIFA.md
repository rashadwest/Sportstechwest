Hi Tiffany,

I hope this email finds you well! It's been too long since we last connected, and I wanted to reach out about something exciting that I think aligns perfectly with your work at FIFA.

I've been building **BallCODE** - an educational platform that teaches coding, math, and AI concepts through sports. We started with basketball, and it's been going really well - we have schools using it, students are engaged, and we're seeing real learning outcomes.

Here's where it gets interesting: **We're launching a soccer version of BallCODE, timed perfectly for World Cup 2026 in the US.** 

Given your role at FIFA and your involvement with the World Cup, I thought you might be interested in what we're building. The soccer version will:
- Teach coding through soccer skills (dribbling, passing, shooting)
- Use World Cup 2026 as a cultural hook to engage students
- Provide educational content that aligns with curriculum standards
- Create a "2.0" experience that builds on our proven basketball framework

**Why I'm reaching out:**

I'd love to explore potential opportunities to collaborate or get your insights on:
1. **Educational partnerships** - Connecting FIFA's educational initiatives with our platform
2. **World Cup 2026 alignment** - Leveraging the World Cup moment for educational impact
3. **Youth engagement** - Reaching students through their passion for soccer
4. **Strategic connections** - Any introductions or partnerships that might make sense

I know you're busy with World Cup preparations, but I'd be grateful for:
- A brief conversation to share what we're building
- Your perspective on educational opportunities around World Cup 2026
- Any connections or partnerships that might be relevant
- Your thoughts on how we could align with FIFA's educational goals

I've put together a detailed roadmap for the soccer version (attached) that outlines our vision, timeline, and how we're planning to leverage World Cup 2026. I'd love to get your feedback on it.

Would you be open to a quick call in the next few weeks? I'm happy to work around your schedule, and I promise to keep it brief and focused.

Thanks so much for considering this, and I hope we can catch up soon!

Best regards,

P.S. - I'd also love to hear how things are going with the World Cup preparations! It must be an incredible experience to be part of such a historic event.

Hi Tiffany,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out about something I think you'd find interesting.

I've been working on **BallCODE** - we teach coding through sports (started with basketball, and it's working really well!). Now we're building a soccer version, and I'm timing it for **World Cup 2026** since it's in the US.

Given your role at FIFA, I thought you might have some insights or connections that could help us make this even better. Would you be open to a quick chat? I'd love to:
