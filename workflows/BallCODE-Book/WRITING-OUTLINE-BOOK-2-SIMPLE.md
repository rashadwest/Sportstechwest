## TITLE
**The Decision Crossover**

## FORMAT
**Words per page:** ~30 words  
**Total pages:** ~10-15 pages  
**Total words:** ~300-450 words

## PLOT (3 Acts - Broken into ~13 pages)

### ACT I: The Predictable Path (~400-500 words)
**What happens:**
- One-on-one situation, defender in front
- Nova tries to go same direction every time (always left)
- Defender reads her moves, blocks every path
- Arc detects: "Decision logic missing. No conditional response."
- Coach Circuit: "Read the defense. If they go left, you go right. That's the logic."
- Nova realizes: "Maybe I need to read and react?"

**End Act I:** Nova decides to learn decision-making

---

### ACT II: The Decision Tree (~400-500 words)
**What happens:**
- Defender gets better at reading moves
- Nova practices crossover dribble
- Learns: "If defense goes left, then crossover right"
- Arc: "If defender moves left, then crossover right. If defender moves right, then crossover left."
- Math: Probability - "If defender goes left 70%, crossover right 70%"
- Coding: IF/THEN logic - "IF defender goes left, THEN crossover right"
- Nova resists: "I just want to go straight, why decide?"
- Coach: "Basketball is about reading and reacting. Code is the same."
- Nova realizes: "This is like if/then code!"

**End Act II:** Nova understands conditional logic

---

### ACT III: The Smart Crossover (~400-500 words)
**What happens:**
- Final seconds, need to get past defender
- Nova reads defender's movement
- Uses if/then logic: "IF defender goes left, THEN crossover right"
- Success! Gets past defender, creates scoring opportunity
- Nova: "Conditional logic works! I can make smart decisions!"
- Connection: "Coding uses if/then to make decisions, just like basketball"

**End Act III:** Nova succeeds using conditional logic

## CHARACTERS

### NOVA (Main Character)
- Point guard, sees court like code
- Frustrated, keeps going same way
- Learns to read and react
- Transforms: From predictable → smart decision-maker

### ARC (AI Assistant)
- Detects problems, gives hints
- Key lines:
  - "Decision logic missing. No conditional response."
  - "Conditional logic needed. Decision tree required."
  - "This is conditional logic we can code."

### COACH CIRCUIT
- Wise mentor
- Key lines:
  - "Read the defense. If they go left, you go right. That's the logic."
  - "Basketball is about reading and reacting. Code is the same."

### READING DEFENDER (The Challenge)
- One-on-one opponent
- Reads every move, predicts direction
- Forces Nova to learn decision-making

---

## WHAT STUDENTS LEARN

### Basketball
- Crossover dribble (changing direction)
- Reading the defense
- Making decisions based on what you see

### AI
- Decision trees
- Conditional logic
- Pattern recognition for predictions

### Math
- Probability: "If defender goes left 70%, crossover right 70%"
- Decision making based on probability
- Statistics: Tracking patterns

### Coding
- IF/THEN conditionals
- Making decisions in code
- Conditional blocks: IF [condition] THEN [action]

## SCENE-BY-SCENE (Write These Scenes)

### ACT I Scenes:
1. **Opening:** One-on-one, defender blocks path
2. **Failed attempts:** Nova goes left every time, defender always there
3. **Arc detects:** "Conditional logic missing"
4. **Coach wisdom:** "Read the defense, make decisions"
5. **Nova's realization:** "Maybe read and react?"

### ACT II Scenes:
1. **Challenge intensifies:** Defender reads every move
2. **Practice:** Nova practices reading defense and crossing over
3. **Pattern recognition:** Arc sees decision tree
4. **Connection made:** "This is like if/then code!"
5. **Understanding:** Conditional logic enables smart decisions

### ACT III Scenes:
1. **Final challenge:** Last chance to get past defender
2. **Application:** Nova reads defense, uses if/then logic
3. **Success:** Nova crosses over, gets past, creates opportunity
4. **Reflection:** "If/then logic is how we make smart decisions!"
5. **Future:** "Now I can use if/then for more complex decisions"

---

## KEY MESSAGES
- Read and react: Make decisions based on what you see
- Conditional logic: IF this, THEN that
- Don't be predictable: Adapt to conditions
- Coding = Basketball: Both use conditional thinking

---

## WORD COUNT TARGET
- ~13 pages total
- ~30 words per page
- **Total: ~300-450 words**

**Note:** This is a picture book format. Each page should be ~30 words with illustrations telling part of the story.

**Start writing! Use this as your guide. Keep it simple, keep it basketball-focused, let the concepts emerge naturally.**
