**Date:** December 24, 2025

## 🎯 THE ISSUE

**"All workflows" page doesn't have "Run workflow" button!**

You need to go to the **specific workflow page** to see the button.

---

## ✅ WHERE TO FIND IT

### **Step 1: Click on the Workflow Name**

**On the "All workflows" page:**
- Look at the **left sidebar**
- You'll see: `.github/workflows/unity-webgl-build.y...`
- **Click on that!**

**OR**

### **Step 2: Use Direct Link**

**I'll open this for you:**
```
https://github.com/rashadwest/BTEBallCODE/actions/workflows/unity-webgl-build.yml
```

**This page has the "Run workflow" button!**

---

## 📋 WHAT YOU'LL SEE

**On the workflow-specific page:**
- ✅ List of runs for THIS workflow only
- ✅ **"Run workflow" button** (blue button on the right side)
- ✅ Filter options
- ✅ Run history

---

## 🎯 HOW TO GET THERE

### **Method 1: Click in Sidebar**
1. On "All workflows" page
2. Look at left sidebar
3. Click: `.github/workflows/unity-webgl-build.y...`
4. You'll see "Run workflow" button!

### **Method 2: Direct Link**
- I'll open the direct link for you
- That page has the button

---

## ✅ QUICK FIX

**I just opened the correct page for you!**

**You should now see:**
- "Run workflow" button on the right side
- List of workflow runs
- All the controls you need

---

**The button is on the workflow-specific page, not the "All workflows" page!**
