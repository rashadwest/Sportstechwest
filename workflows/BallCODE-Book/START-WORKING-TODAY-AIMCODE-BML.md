## 📋 Today's BML Cycle Setup

### If Today is BUILD Phase (Monday-Wednesday)

**Morning: CLEAR Framework**
1. **Clarity**: What are we building today?
   - [ ] Story episode? (Which episode?)
I am telling the story of Ava and how keeping it simple makes a world of difference especially when just starting out
   - [ ] Game feature? (Which feature?)
We are introducing the simple command structure where you put in a command where you set the stage and then the line of code is a 1 pound dribble as a block of code and then the Pound() along witht the direction which is an event and then you also put in the type of shot or pass which is another event. This is the introduction to our code. We are also introducing AI with WatsonX being in a earpiece in her ear. I think we should probably mention it and have a sort of audio element that shows that is what happen without showing it if you know what I m ean 
   - [ ] Website page? (Which page?)
On the landing page you have it where the Books are listed 1-3 at the bottom and you are able to select them but you need to be logged in and have a password to be able to get them. I think this can show the functionality without it actually working for tomorrow. It is mock or if we can get it working that would be even better. 
   - [ ] Integration? (What integration?)
When you click on the book it should go to the video link in the unity game and that runs the story as a video and then takes you directly to that particular training module mode that has you do the pound dribble using coding logic

2. **Logic**: How does this build systematically?
   - [ ] What does this build on? (Previous episode/feature)
This is where we are starting with the easiest dribble in basketball and the most fundamental action that is not boring and also can be shown easily in our game
   - [ ] What is the systematic progression?
After this we will do crossover and start to introduce type of shots and then in & out and another type of shot until we have introduced a bunch of basic concepts in a fun and compelling way.
   - [ ] How do concepts layer?
I think we add AI and math where it seamlessly makes sense it would be great to get your advice on this. Keep the curriculum simple but keep it compling on each other consistently

3. **Examples**: What examples inform this?
   - [ ] Previous successful stories/features
   Use our stories that I create only. This is an original concept
   - [ ] Case studies or research
   Use the AIMCODE build measure learn to develop case studies as we go. We have worked with kids and families throughout the years and I have some quotes and feedback but now we are lookign to do it at scale
   - [ ] Similar educational content
   Scratch is probably the close but they are not really fusing the sports component too much 

4. **Adaptation**: What constraints exist?
I think we need to create the framework fast and scale fast so we can get over a bunch of the tiktok noise and get everyone using the system 
   - [ ] Time constraints?
I really want to get this out before basketball season is over with this year with January being a huge launch during CES 
   - [ ] Technical constraints?
I think we have that covered but the issues with the 2 player mode. Right now I have them giving the computer back and forth but would love to where people can play on seperate computers against each other
   - [ ] Content constraints?
Producing these story books is alot for me while still building out the program consistently 

5. **Results**: How will we measure success?
I want to have schools and partnerships coming on board consistently along with kids wanting to ask their teachers to play the game after their first time 
   - [ ] What metrics will we track?
We want to keep up with how much better then understand and can use AI, coding, and math 
   - [ ] What does success look like?
Having testimonials that teachers, kids, and parents are using the product and they love it 
   - [ ] What is the hypothesis?
TO solve the global education crisis of boredom and lack of engagment in learning from youth through sport and entertainment is the mote.

### Issue: "I'm stuck on BUILD phase"
**Solution:**
1. Review `AIMCODE-BML-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` for BUILD checklist
2. Ensure CLEAR framework is complete
3. Check expert principles are applied

### Issue: "I don't have metrics to measure"
**Solution:**
1. If first week, focus on BUILD only
2. Set up metrics collection for next week
3. Use qualitative feedback if available
