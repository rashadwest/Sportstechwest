# Soccer Curriculum: Scalable System Design
## AIMCODE Expert-Driven Foundation Framework

**Date:** December 2025  
**Methodology:** AIMCODE (CLEAR + Alpha Evolve + Research + Experts)  
**Purpose:** Scalable curriculum system starting with foundation, ready for passes  
**Status:** 🎯 Foundation Design Phase

---

## 🎯 CLEAR FRAMEWORK

### C - Clarity

**Objective:** Create a scalable curriculum system for soccer that:
- Starts with foundation (dribbling skills 1-7)
- Can accommodate passes (to be added tomorrow)
- Scales to future skills (shooting, defending, etc.)
- Maintains same structure as basketball for consistency

**Constraints:**
- Must use same number system (1-7) as basketball
- Must align with educational standards
- Must be scalable for future additions
- Must follow AIMCODE methodology

**Format:** Structured curriculum framework with extensible skill categories

**Audience:** Students (grades 3-12), teachers, curriculum developers

**Results:** Scalable system that grows from foundation → passes → advanced skills

---

### L - Logic

**Systematic Approach (Alpha Evolve - Hassabis):**

**Layer 1: Foundation (Current)**
- Dribbling skills (1-7)
- Basic ball control
- Movement patterns

**Layer 2: Passing (Tomorrow)**
- Types of passes
- Passing sequences
- Tactical passing

**Layer 3: Advanced Skills (Future)**
- Shooting
- Defending
- Tactical formations

**Layer 4: Integration**
- Skill combinations
- Game scenarios
- Real-world application

**Logic Flow:**
1. Start with foundation (dribbling 1-7)
2. Add passing layer (extensible structure)
3. Build advanced skills on foundation
4. Integrate all skills into game scenarios

---

### E - Examples

**Reference Models:**
1. **Basketball Curriculum** - Proven structure, same number system
2. **Scratch Curriculum** - Progressive skill building
3. **Duolingo** - Skill tree progression
4. **Code.org** - Scalable curriculum framework

**Best Practices:**
- Progressive difficulty (easy → hard)

- Modular design (add skills without breaking system)
- Standards alignment (CSTA, Common Core)

---

### A - Adaptation

**Scalable Design:**
- Skill categories (extensible)
- Number system (1-7 for each category)
- Modular structure (add new skills easily)
- Framework reuse (same structure, different skills)

**Flexibility:**
- Can add passes tomorrow
- Can add shooting later
- Can add defending later
- Can add tactical skills later

---

### R - Results

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Foundation documented (dribbling 1-7)
