## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Book 3: The Pattern (In & Out Dribble)** teaches **loops and repetition** through basketball deception. Students learn to create patterns, build expectation, and break loops at the perfect moment.

**Python Concept:** Loops (`for` loops, `range()`, pattern creation)  
**Basketball Skill:** In & Out Dribble (creating patterns, breaking them)  
**AI Concept:** Pattern Recognition and Loop Detection

## 📚 THREE-PHASE LEARNING PATHWAY

### Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)

**What Students Do:**
- Learn loops using basketball terminology
- Visual block interface: REPEAT [fake left] 3 TIMES, THEN [go right]
- Drag blocks to create loop patterns
- Immediate feedback through game exercises

**Block Coding Example:**
```
REPEAT [Block 3: Fake Left] 3 TIMES
THEN [Block 3: Go Right]
```

**Learning Objective:**
- Students understand that loops repeat patterns
- Students can create loop patterns using blocks
- Students see that breaking loops creates opportunity

**Assessment:**
- Block coding exercises in game
- Pattern creation challenges
- Loop completion tasks

---

### Phase 2: Transition Bridge

**What Students Do:**
- See how loop blocks map to Python code
- Side-by-side view: Block loop | Python `for` loop
- Understand that blocks = code
- See Python syntax alongside blocks

**Bridge Example:**
```
Block: REPEAT [fake left] 3 TIMES
Code:  for i in range(3):
           fake_left()
```

**Learning Objective:**
- Students understand that loop blocks = Python `for` loops
- Students see Python loop syntax in context
- Students recognize loop patterns in code

**Assessment:**
- Side-by-side comparison exercises
- Pattern recognition activities
- Code reading (not writing yet)

---

### Phase 3: Python Learning

**What Students Do:**
- Write Python `for` loops
- Use `range()` to control repetitions
- Create loop patterns in code
- Break loops at the right moment

**Python Code Example:**
```python
# Create pattern: repeat 3 times
for i in range(3):
    fake_left()
    print(f"Fake {i+1}")

# Break pattern: go right
go_right()
print("Pattern broken!")
```

**Learning Objective:**
- Students can write Python `for` loops
- Students understand `range()` function
- Students apply loops to create patterns
- Students are ready for advanced loops

**Assessment:**
- Python code writing exercises
- Loop pattern projects
- Real-world problem solving

## 🧩 EMBEDDED MICRO-EXERCISES (IN-BOOK) + DRILL MAPPING

**Purpose:** Book 3 includes short in-book micro-exercises to reinforce loops before/after the game drill.

### Micro-exercise IDs (stable tracking units)
- Book micro-exercise IDs: `B3-A{act}-S{scene}-E{num}`
- Game drill IDs: `G-B3-A{act}-S{scene}-D{num}` (implemented as optional `step=1..7` within `exercise=deception-loop`)

| Micro ID | Phase 1 (Blocks) | Phase 2 (Bridge) | Phase 3 (Python) | Game Drill |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `B3-A1-S1-E1` | Identify what repeats | Match repeat → `range(3)` meaning | Read: “repeat 3 times” | `G-B3-A1-S1-D1` (`step=1`) |
| `B3-A1-S1-E2` | Count repeats | Connect count → loop count | Read loop count | `G-B3-A1-S1-D2` (`step=2`) |
| `B3-A2-S1-E1` | Fill missing block in loop | Compare blocks ↔ `for i in range(3)` | Preview loop structure | `G-B3-A2-S1-D1` (`step=3`) |
| `B3-A2-S1-E2` | “How many runs?” | `range(3)` → 3 runs | Trace loop | `G-B3-A2-S1-D2` (`step=4`) |
| `B3-A2-S1-E3` | Fix repeat count in blocks | Show mismatch count | Fix `range(2)` → `range(3)` | `G-B3-A2-S1-D3` (`step=5`) |
| `B3-A3-S1-E1` | Choose best pattern | Explain why repetition matters | Connect to strategy | `G-B3-A3-S1-D1` (`step=6`) |
| `B3-A3-S1-E2` | Change repeat count | Change `n` in both views | `range(4)` / repeat 4 | `G-B3-A3-S1-D2` (`step=7`) |
