**Features:**
- Python code editor with syntax validation
- Basketball Python API (dribble, pass, shoot, move, conditionals, loops)
- Code execution on basketball court
- Block-to-Python bridge view (side-by-side comparison)
- Exercise system with hints and solutions

### 3. School Appeal Strategy ✅

**Created:**

### What Needs Work ⚠️

1. **Website ↔ Everything**
   - Missing "For Schools" section
   - No Python mode showcase
   - Learning pathway not visually clear
   - No standards alignment page

2. **Python Game Mode**
   - Script created but needs integration
   - Exercises need to be created
   - Block-to-Python bridge needs implementation

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - PD guide needs Python section
   - Curriculum needs Python exercises
   - Books need Python exercise links

## 🐍 PYTHON GAME MODE OVERVIEW

### How It Works

**Same as Block Coding, But with Python:**

1. **Students write Python code:**
   ```python
   dribble('move', 0.5)
   dribble('pound', 0.5)
   shoot()
   ```

2. **Code executes on basketball court:**
   - Same visual feedback as block coding
   - Same basketball context
   - Same challenges and terminology

3. **Progressive difficulty:**
   - Level 1: Simple sequences
   - Level 2: Variables
   - Level 3: Conditionals
   - Level 4: Loops
   - Level 5: Functions

### Basketball Python API

**Core Functions:**
- `dribble(action, clock)` - Execute dribble move
- `pass_to(direction)` - Pass the ball
- `shoot()` - Shoot the ball
- `move(direction, distance)` - Move player
- `if_defender(condition, action)` - Conditional logic
- `repeat(times, action)` - Loop structures

### Block-to-Python Bridge

**Side-by-Side View:**
- Blocks on left, Python on right
- Click block → see Python equivalent
- Click Python → highlight corresponding block
- Gradual transition support

   - ✅ Teacher resources ready
   - ⚠️ Python training needed
   - ⚠️ School materials needed

### Website Enhancements Needed

1. **"For Schools" Section**
   - Value proposition
   - Standards alignment
   - Implementation timeline
   - Teacher resources preview

2. **Learning Pathway Visual**
   - Interactive diagram
   - Progress indicators
   - Grade level recommendations
   - Time estimates

3. **Python Mode Showcase**
   - Demo video
   - Side-by-side: blocks vs. Python
   - Code examples
   - Student progression examples
