# After Uploading .alf File - What Unity Gives You

**Date:** December 24, 2025  
**Situation:** Uploaded activation file, Unity asking for serial number

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You're on the Wrong Page!

**The page asking for serial number is for Unity Plus/Pro (paid licenses).**

**For Unity Personal (free), Unity should have given you:**
- ✅ A license file (`.ulf`) to download
- ✅ OR a serial number on a different page
- ✅ OR redirected you to a different section

---

## 🔍 WHERE TO FIND YOUR LICENSE

**After uploading `.alf` file, Unity usually:**

1. **Shows a download link** for `.ulf` file
2. **Displays a serial number** on the same page
3. **Sends an email** with license information
4. **Shows it in Unity ID account**

**Let's check all these places:**
