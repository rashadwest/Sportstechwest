## CHARACTER SETUP

Lets make the characters into our robot characters for our system that you see in the images. The 4 orange robot characters with others look like it and Ava as the only person playing.

## ACT I: THE PRESS

### Scene 1: Opening - The Chaos Begins

I have the ball for the first time in the first game I have ever played for any school.

They are full court pressing and I am trapped immediately

I feel nerves that I do not want to mess up, things are moving so fast, and all I hear is noise, It is like being at a heavy metal concert because the students are jumping up and down. I have my coach in my head "I believe in you Ava!"

She sees and feels that if she simplifies the game and limits her move to 1-3 dribbles she will be more effective.

I wanted to dribble but there was no room because everyone was huge and there were no angles. I threw the ball and turned it over. My Coach told me "to trust my training and not to get frustrated."

There was no way to know how they were going to play us but they were playing an aggressive press and they were playing on the top side of all of our players. This made it difficult because all of our offensives started with a pass to the wing. We should have practiced a back door cut or something for these situations. It seemed like they had 7 players to our 5 with how they were everywhere on the press and then they made sure that our offense could not function. This is when I thought about WatsonX but I didn't act on using AI then.

### Scene 2: Failed Attempts

She goes to do here moves and get into her bag. Just think "And 1" streetball where she is doing move after move trying to get by this elite defender but they are like a wall. There is no fail as we just had some turnovers and were missing alot of shots.

## ACT II: THE FOUNDATION

### Scene 4: The Math Connection

Ava comes off the screen with the mindset of just getting to a spot and she does that with a quick dribble if needed and if not she shoots. WatsonX gives her the understanding of the efficiency of what she is doing now and how she is being much more effective with her +/- (see glossary)

### Scene 5: The Coding Connection

She gets a block from WatsonX of the open spot so when they start taking away the catch and shot she starts to take that one dribble into the block

### Scene 6: The Struggle and Acceptance

She keeps wanting to do more but the Coach and WatsonX tell her to stick with the process.

## ACT III: BREAKING THROUGH

### Scene 1: Final Challenge

Ava focuses on the blocks that are given to her even within the press break passing and cutting and only using the pound dribble in the blocks where she absolutely needs it.

### Scene 2: Application - Using the Sequence

She saw that they now see what she is doing so now she adds in an additional dribble into her sequence going from pound to pound, pound, pound dribble.

### Scene 3: Success - Breaking the Press

She is finally able to break the press and within the offense get her shot off and strategically decide what is the best move hitting shots and helping her team advance the ball time after time.

### Scene 4: Reflection - The Connection

"Sometimes you just have to stick to the fundamentals that you learned first."

"When someone is really good on defense, you have to strategically use your teammates and WatsonX to strategize how to get through the defense to win."

"That is the power of data and analytics along with feel. I felt something that I told the AI that helped me to get an understanding of what is going on."

Focus on using stats, data, and analytics to learn from mistakes and help with my feel. Especially when struggling. Keeping the game simple is sometimes the most effective way to get things done.

### Scene 5: Future - What's Next

My Coach and our team were pleased with my performance and the win no matter how I played!
