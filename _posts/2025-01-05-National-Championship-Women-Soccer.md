### UNC Vs. Wake Forest
 
I saw the game on [espn](https://www.espn.com/) and realized it was right next to the city I was raised in Raleigh, NC. I go over to Cary, NC and had to find parking.

I then had to walk in a pattern to go out toward the street and around the "forest" to get to the game. It was an adventure but not as much as my journey to the car and out of the parking lot I will tell you about.

The game was packed with about 90% UNC fans. There is a reason why! I will argue that they are the most dominating college sports team of all time.

The stats they have put up in regards to NCAA tournaments over 40, Final four's 32, and championships at 22 is crazy.

The game was intense but was somewhat sloppy. There was no real moments of the game where you felt one team had an advantage over the other. The one thing I would say is the UNC attack kept getting good run outs that were starting to have potential.

This pressure would eventually enable them to win a free kick right outside the penalty box. The ball was struck well beat the goal keeper and that was the goal that would eventually win the game. It was a great time as I met UNC grads and people who were interested in what made me come out to the game.

I struggled to get footage of them running out after the game because my phone was almost dead so I was a little annoyed about that. People were so happy about UNC winning it lifted me up.

I then headed back to the car and decided to go through the woods this time with people. With my phone dead I had to depend on the person in front of me to lead me with there flashlight. I am just thankful to God that I do not have a twisted ankle. Then the parking lot was a bottle neck so it was a long wait and with no phone the radio would sufficie. It was good times! I was sitting there reflecting on it listening to my music.


### Duke vs Incarnate Word

I was invited to Duke for a game with my guy B.Merritt and had the opportunity to get shown around by Jae Lucas and the  Duke staff. It was great being able to chop it up with some of the Freshman including Cooper Flagg, Darren Harris, and Slim. I think it is starting to make me want to be around the game more and more.

I also met TJ Ford for the first time as he had a son playing for Incarnate Word. He is now a player performance coach down in Houston.

I had been there a while ago when playing with my friend Ryan Kelly around the time he was there and it still looked very similar.

They added the newest technology like the Noah but other than that it is still a small stadium but just the look and feel of everything gives it prestige. We counted up how many Duke players have played in the NBA and I think it was like 96 if I'm not mistaken.

O yeah, the game wasn't the best for either side but I enjoyed being in the atmosphere and engaging with the fans.

### GLeague Showcase

When I showed up at the showcase I wasn't sure of what to expect.

When I walked in it was a vip entrance and the event was invite only. I ended up walking around and seeing many people I already knew.

Catching up with individuals from playing like Kyle Hines, Ish Smith, Earnest Scott, and meeting some new friends that I've developed from Front Office like the GM's and Scouts was also amazing.

I expect to go there every year.
