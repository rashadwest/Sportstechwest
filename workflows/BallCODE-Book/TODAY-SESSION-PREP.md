# Today's Session Prep - Saturday November 15, 2025
## Deep Work Window: 2pm-3pm (Starting in ~1.5 hours)

## 🎯 THE ONE THING

**Task:** Create, record, and upload 3 dribble-level books (Levels 1-3) to website with paywall

**Why This Domino:**
- Unblocks revenue generation (can start accepting payments)
- Creates content for Triangle Science & Math Academy and NC Science & Math contacts
- Establishes production workflow for remaining 4 books
- Moves from planning to execution

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 3 complete stories written (using format template)
- [ ] 3 stories recorded (browser recording, high quality)
- [ ] 3 stories uploaded to website
- [ ] Paywall system functional (book-by-book and bundle options)
- [ ] Content quality high enough for target schools

## 📊 Yesterday's Progress (What Was Completed)

**Based on project files:**

### Content Creation: **95% Complete**
- Episode 1 story: ✅ 100% (1,497 words)
- Skill Pit-Stop: ✅ 90% (needs polish)
- Exercises: ✅ 90% (needs testing)
- Visual briefs: ✅ 100%
- **Visual assets: ❌ 0%** (critical blocker for some tasks)

### Planning & Documentation: **100% Complete**
- Game integration specs: ✅ 100%
- Outreach materials: ✅ 100%
- Beta testing package: ✅ 100%
- Project tracking: ✅ 100%

### Overall Project: **35% Complete**
- Episode 1 MVP: 45%
- Website updates: 0%
- Story mode integration: 30%

**Key Insight:** Content creation is strong (95%), but execution (visuals, website, implementation) is lagging. Today's focus on creating and uploading books addresses the execution gap.

## 🎥 Recording Setup Guide

### Browser Recording Best Practices

**Recommended Tools:**
1. **Chrome/Edge Built-in Screen Recording** (Best quality)
   - Right-click → Inspect → More Tools → Recorder
   - Records at full browser resolution
   - No download needed

2. **Loom Extension** (If available)
   - High quality (1080p)
   - Easy sharing
   - Browser-based

3. **OBS Studio (Browser Source)** (If you can install)
   - Highest quality
   - Full control
   - Requires download

### Recording Settings for Best Quality:

**Resolution:**
- Minimum: 1920x1080 (1080p)
- Ideal: 2560x1440 (1440p) or 3840x2160 (4K) if available

**Frame Rate:**
- Minimum: 30 fps
- Ideal: 60 fps

**Audio:**
- Use external microphone if available
- Test audio levels before recording
- Record in quiet environment

**Browser Settings:**
- Full screen browser window
- Zoom at 100% (not zoomed in/out)
- Close unnecessary tabs
- Clear browser cache for faster loading

**Recording Tips:**
- Record in one continuous take (can edit later if needed)
- Pause between acts if needed (can be edited out)
- Test recording for 10 seconds first to check quality
- Save recordings with clear names: "Book-1-Dribble-Level-1.mp4"

## 🔄 Delegation Plan

### What You Do:
1. ✅ Write stories (using format template)
2. ✅ Record stories (browser recording)
3. ✅ Review outlines (ensure they match your vision)

### What AI Does:
1. ✅ Create story outlines/thought structures
2. ✅ Upload videos to website
3. ✅ Set up paywall system (book-by-book + bundle)
4. ✅ Format pages for optimal viewing
5. ✅ Create payment integration (Stripe/PayPal/etc.)
6. ✅ Test payment flow

### Escalation Triggers:
- If story outline doesn't match your vision → Review and adjust
- If recording quality issues → Troubleshoot settings
- If upload fails → Debug and retry
- If paywall doesn't work → Fix immediately

## ⏱️ Time Estimates

**Per Book:**
- Story outline review: 5 minutes
- Story writing: 30-45 minutes (1,200-1,800 words)
- Recording: 10-15 minutes (5-8 minute story + setup)
- Upload & setup: 5 minutes (AI handles)

**Total Per Book:** ~1 hour  
**3 Books Today:** ~3 hours  
**Your Deep Work Window:** 2 hours (2pm-3pm)

**Recommendation:** 
- Start with Book 1 outline review now (before 2pm)
- Write Book 1 during deep work (2pm-2:30pm)
- Record Book 1 (2:30pm-2:45pm)
- Repeat for Books 2-3, or continue tomorrow

## 🎯 Quality Standards (Triangle Science & Math, NC Science & Math)

**Content Must Be:**
- ✅ Rigorous enough for advanced students
- ✅ Clearly explains AI/math/coding concepts
- ✅ Engaging enough to hold attention
- ✅ Educational value evident
- ✅ Professional presentation

**Story Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Starts with basketball action (not concept explanation)
- [ ] Basketball terminology used naturally
- [ ] AI/math/coding concepts emerge FROM basketball needs
- [ ] 3-act structure followed
- [ ] Basketball success demonstrates mastery
- [ ] Engaging and adventurous (70% story, 30% skill)
- [ ] Word count: 1,200-1,800 words

## 💡 Is This The Best Use of Your Time?

### Assessment:

**✅ YES - This is the right focus because:**

1. **Revenue Generation:** Creates sellable product immediately
2. **Target Audience Ready:** Content for Triangle Science & Math, NC Science & Math contacts
3. **Production Workflow:** Establishes process for remaining 4 books
4. **Execution Gap:** Addresses the 0% website implementation
5. **Tuesday Deadline:** Gets content ready for value presentation by Tuesday

**⚠️ Considerations:**

- **Visual Assets:** Still at 0% - but not needed for video recordings
- **Game Integration:** Still at 30% - but books can be standalone initially
- **Outreach:** Still at 0% - but books are needed before outreach

**Recommendation:** **YES, proceed with books.** This creates immediate value and unblocks revenue. Visual assets and game integration can happen in parallel or after books are complete.
