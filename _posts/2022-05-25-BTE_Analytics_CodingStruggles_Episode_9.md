# Coding Struggles 

I have been working on two things all day today. 

1. Developing our coding system for our algorithm.
    - I have developed a couple of ways of extracting the data we need using python 
    - Now I am looking to take it straight from the csv file 

2. Importing a CSV or excel file into a jupiter notebook. 
    - Right now I am using google colab and the challenge I am having is error code after error code.
    - I am going to look into more ways to add the file 


  - ![Struggle1]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/blog-img/Struggle1.png?raw=true)
  - ![Struggle2]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/blog-img/Struggle2.png?raw=true)


I need to work on being more productive when I cannot accomplish a goal that I wanted to accomplish on the workday.
