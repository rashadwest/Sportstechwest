## 🎮 About WebGL (Quick Note)

**WebGL = Technology, NOT a service**

- ✅ You need: **Netlify account** (to host the game)
- ✅ You need: **Unity** (to build the game)
- ❌ You DON'T need: A separate WebGL account (it's built into Unity)

**The process:**
1. Unity builds game as WebGL
2. Deploy WebGL files to Netlify
3. Game runs in browsers
