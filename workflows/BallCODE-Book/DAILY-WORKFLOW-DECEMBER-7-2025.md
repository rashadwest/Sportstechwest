## 🎯 5 QUESTIONS TO START TODAY - ANSWERS

### 1. Energy and Time
**Energy Level:** 8/10 ✅  
**Focused Time Available:** Deep work window 4-6pm (going hard)  
**Weekend Balance:** Walking and enjoying the day

### 2. ONE Thing Today
**Answer:** Get n8n workflow working so we can edit the game with prompts  
**Why:** If we have integration working and n8n finished, we can edit the game with prompts - we're winning no doubt. This unlocks game development and lets us build out the game alongside the book.

**Additional Notes:**
- Make sure n8n workflow works today - this is THE one thing
- Can really build out the game with this done
- Game can work alongside the book once operational
- Consider integrating book into workflow (but only if it doesn't complicate things - shelve if it makes it more complex)
- Simplify n8n workflow - fewer nodes = less potential to break
- Use AIMCODE to find what has worked and what has not online for cleanest code

### 3. What's Blocking You?
**Biggest Blocker:** n8n workflow is stopping us from getting the game better for production  
**Specific Blockers:**
- Game development blocked by lack of resources to edit game with prompts
- n8n workflow needs to be operational

**Screenshot-to-Fix Strategy:**
- This is how we'll fix n8n issues
- User will provide screenshots of each node that's not working
- AI will create another JSON file with the fix
- **Save to memory:** Look at date and time of each screenshot within the screenshot document when updating

### 4. Quick Win vs Deep Work
**Quick Win:** Get header image to work (can be done before deep work)  
**Deep Work (4-6pm):** Get n8n workflow working so we can edit the game - going hard on this  
**Confidence:** Trust in team (AI + User) to knock it out

### 5. What Can Wait?
**Can Wait Until Monday:**
- Sending stuff to clients about development and what we're doing
- Client communication

**Locked In On:**
- n8n workflow completion
- Game editing via prompts
- Integration working
