üèÄüí° **Championship Basketball is Systematic Thinking**

I've been digging into [**NBA data**](https://www.nba.com/stats) and here's what's clear: elite basketball decision-making works the same way as systematic problem-solving.

The [**Corner 3**](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) isn't just another shot. It's the smartest decision in basketball.

---

## The Corner 3 Decision Tree

### Step 1: Primary Check
* If corner shooter is open ‚Üí Pass it immediately (38% makes, 1.14 points per shot)

### Step 2: Setup
* If defense helps ‚Üí Create advantage, kick to corner
* If no look ‚Üí Keep the ball moving

### Step 3: Execute
* When the condition is right ‚Üí Take the highest-value shot (layup if available (1.20 PPP)‚Üí corner 3 if available (1.14 PPP) ‚Üí Top of the Key 3 Pointer ‚Üí etc. Deviate when you have other options that make sense for your situation or personnel.

## The Hockey Assist = Setup Logic

In plain English: It's the action that sets someone else up to win.

* **In basketball** ‚Üí The pass before the assist (64% of corner 3s need it)
* **In business** ‚Üí The prep work before the deal closes
* **In life** ‚Üí The behind-the-scenes effort that makes success possible

### Impact by the numbers:
* **With setup**: 41.2%
* **Without setup**: 32.1%
* **That's a 28% boost** just from preparation

---

## Why This Logic Wins

### Efficiency:
* **Corner 3** = 1.14 points per shot, 38% hit rate
* **92% involve teamwork**
* **1.75 feet closer** than other threes

### More prep = better outcome:
* **1 pass** ‚Üí 28.5%
* **2 passes** ‚Üí 34.2%
* **3 passes** ‚Üí 39.8%
* **4+ passes** ‚Üí 43.1%

## Proof from Champions

### Boston Celtics (2024 Champs):
* Corner specialists hitting over 50%
* Built on the extra pass
* **Result**: Championship

### Golden State Warriors Dynasty:
* Steve Kerr's "ball movement to corner 3" system
* 300+ passes a night
* **Result**: 4 titles

## Core Principles

* **Highest Value First**: Always look for the most efficient shot
* **Setup Wins**: Prep work drives results
* **Collaboration Over Isolation**: 92% of corner 3s come from teamwork
* **Patience Matters**: Average 18.7 seconds before a corner 3
* **Repeat the System**: Consistency creates scalability

## The Framework in Action

1. **Is the best option available?** ‚Üí Take it
2. **Can I create it?** ‚Üí Setup play (hockey assist)
3. **No option yet?** ‚Üí Keep the ball moving
