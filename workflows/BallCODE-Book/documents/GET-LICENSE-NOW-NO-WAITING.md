## ✅ YOU CAN DO THIS YOURSELF - NO WAITING!

**You don't need to wait for Unity support!** Here are ALL the ways you can get the license RIGHT NOW:

---

## 🚀 METHOD 1: Upload Activation File (5 Minutes - DO THIS NOW!)

**This is the FASTEST way - you can do it yourself!**

### **Step 1: Upload File**

1. **I opened the Unity website for you**
2. **Click:** "Upload" or "Browse" button
3. **Select:** `Unity_v2021.3.10f1.alf`
   - Location: `/Users/rashadwest/Sportstechwest/workflows/BallCODE-Book/Unity_v2021.3.10f1.alf`
4. **Click:** "Upload"
5. **Wait:** 10-30 seconds (Unity processes it)

### **Step 2: Get License**

**Unity will immediately give you:**
- **Option A:** Download button → Click it → Open file → Copy everything
- **Option B:** Serial number → Copy the numbers

### **Step 3: Add to GitHub**

1. **I opened GitHub Secrets page for you**
2. **Click:** "New repository secret"
3. **Name:** `UNITY_LICENSE` (if file) OR `UNITY_SERIAL` (if serial)
4. **Secret:** Paste what Unity gave you
5. **Click:** "Add secret"

### **Step 4: Done!**

**Build will work immediately!**

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**No waiting required!**

## 🚀 METHOD 2: Check Unity Hub (2 Minutes)

**I opened Unity Hub for you:**

1. **In Unity Hub:**
   - Click **Settings** (gear icon, top right)
   - Click **Licenses** (left sidebar)
   - Click on your license
   - **Look for:** Serial Number

2. **If serial is visible:**
   - Copy it
   - Add to GitHub Secrets as `UNITY_SERIAL`
   - Done!

**Time:** 2 minutes  
**No waiting required!**

## 🚀 METHOD 3: Try Entitlement License (1 Minute - May Work!)

**I found an entitlement license file on your Mac!**

**Let's try using it:**

1. **I opened the licenses folder for you**
2. **Find:** `UnityEntitlementLicense.xml`
3. **Open it** in TextEdit
4. **Copy ALL contents**
5. **Add to GitHub Secrets** as `UNITY_LICENSE`
6. **Test build**

**This might work!** It's Unity's new license format, and some CI/CD systems support it.

**Time:** 1 minute  
**No waiting required!**

---

## 🚀 METHOD 4: Build Locally (Workaround - No CI/CD License Needed!)

**If nothing else works, build locally:**

1. **Build on your Mac:**
   - Open Unity Editor
   - Build → WebGL
   - Build completes locally (no license issues)

2. **Upload to Netlify:**
   - Manually upload build folder
   - OR use a script to automate it

**This bypasses the CI/CD license issue entirely!**

**Time:** 10 minutes to set up  
**No waiting required!**
