## If Time is Limited

### Minimal Viable Option:
1. Generate State Diagram only (most important for concept)
2. Use placeholder text for other visuals in presentation
3. Generate other visuals after Saturday

### Quick Alternative:
1. Use simple graphics/diagrams
2. Create basic state diagram manually (Figma/Canva)
3. Use stock basketball images with tech overlays
4. Focus on content over visuals

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: AI generates poor quality images
**Solution:** 
- Refine prompts (add more detail)
- Try different tool
- Generate more variations
- Use manual creation as backup

### Problem: Images don't match style
**Solution:**
- Add style keywords to prompt ("modern", "clean", "professional")
- Generate more variations
- Use consistent prompts across all 3 images

### Problem: Images are too scary/not kid-friendly
**Solution:**
- Adjust prompt (add "kid-friendly", "not scary", "age-appropriate")
- Regenerate with adjusted prompt
- For Shadow Press Scouts: emphasize "cool villain" not "horror"

### Problem: No time to generate
**Solution:**
- Use placeholder text in presentation
- Generate visuals after Saturday
- Focus on content and demo
- Visuals are nice-to-have, not critical

---

## Success Criteria

**Visuals are ready when:**
- ✅ All 3 images generated
- ✅ High-resolution versions downloaded
- ✅ Images added to presentation
- ✅ Images added to Episode 1
- ✅ Everything tested and working
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Kid-friendly and appropriate

---

**Status:** Ready to execute - Follow steps above to generate visuals

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours total

**Priority:** HIGH - Visuals significantly improve presentation impact
