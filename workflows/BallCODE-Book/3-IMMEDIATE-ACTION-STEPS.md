# 3 Immediate Action Steps - Right Now

**Date:** Today  
**Goal:** Move forward on sales and product development with concrete, actionable steps

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Sales - Build IBM Saturday Presentation Deck (2 hours)

**What:** Create the actual PowerPoint/Keynote presentation from your existing outline

**Why This Matters:**
- IBM Saturday is your biggest immediate sales opportunity
- You have the outline (`IBM-Presentation-Deck-Outline.md`) but need the actual deck
- A polished presentation = professional credibility = better partnership outcomes

**Action Items:**
1. Open `IBM-Presentation-Deck-Outline.md` (you already have this)
2. Create new PowerPoint/Keynote file
3. Build slides using the outline content (7-10 slides)
4. Add placeholder text for visuals: "Visual: [Court Map showing tech elements]"
5. Save as `IBM-BallCODE-Presentation.pptx` or `.key`

**Time:** 2 hours  
**Outcome:** Professional presentation ready for Saturday

**If You Have Extra Time:**
- Generate 1-2 key visuals using prompts from `automated_outputs/plan2_visual_prompts.json`
- Add visuals to presentation
- Practice run-through (30 minutes)

## 🛠️ Step 2: Product Development - Prepare Developer Meeting Package (1 hour)

**What:** Organize everything the developer needs to answer your 3 questions and start building

**Why This Matters:**
- Developer meeting is your product development blocker
- Clear questions = faster answers = faster build start
- Organized package = professional = developer takes you seriously

**Action Items:**
1. Review `DEVELOPER-QUESTIONS-FOR-TOMORROW.md` (you have this)
2. Create a single email/document with:
   - The 3 questions clearly formatted
   - Links to relevant Unity scripts (`Unity-Scripts/StoryModeManager.cs`, etc.)
   - What you're bringing (scripts, content, checklist)
   - What you need from them (answers to 3 questions)
3. Attach or link to:
   - `Unity-Scripts/QUICK-INTEGRATION-CHECKLIST.md` (if it exists)
   - Episode 1 story content
   - Any integration specs
4. Send to developer TODAY (so they can prepare)

**Time:** 1 hour  
**Outcome:** Developer arrives prepared, meeting is productive, you get answers

**If You Have Extra Time:**
- Check if Unity scripts exist and are ready
- Create a simple visual diagram of what Episode 1 needs
- Prepare backup questions if developer can't answer main 3

## 🚀 Step 3: Unblock Both - Confirm Website/Demo Readiness (30 minutes)

**What:** Verify what you can actually demo/show for IBM Saturday and pilot schools

**Why This Matters:**
- IBM Saturday needs a working demo (even if simple)
- Pilot schools need to know what they're getting
- Unblocks both sales (presentation) and product (delivery expectations)

**Action Items:**
1. Check domain status: Do you own `ballcode.co`? Is it configured?
2. Check hosting: Do you have web hosting ready? (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
3. Check demo options:
   - Option A: Deploy simple Episode 1 web page (if you have 3-5 days)
   - Option B: Prepare local demo on laptop (if no hosting yet)
   - Option C: Use existing `automated_outputs/episode1_page.html` as demo
4. Test QR codes: Print and scan to verify they work
5. Decide: What can you actually show Saturday?
   - Full website? → Great, use it
   - Local demo? → Prepare laptop demo
   - Static page? → Use HTML file as demo

**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Outcome:** Clear demo plan for Saturday, no surprises

**If You Have Extra Time:**
- Deploy simple Episode 1 page to hosting (if domain ready)
- Create backup demo script (talking points)
- Test everything end-to-end
