Being in Boston for the MIT XR Hackathon was a powerful reminder of how far the XR field has come and the part I’ve been able to play in it. As one of the first people in this space, it felt special to see it evolve firsthand. The opportunity to work with some of the best developers in XR at the MIT Media Lab was incredible. The conversations I had were next level, especially with people who are not only innovating but reshaping how immersive tech is experienced.

Seeing the latest advancements in headsets and 3D printing tech gave me new insights into where XR is headed, and I found myself more motivated than ever to keep pushing forward in this space. On top of the tech and networking, I also got to see my dad's side of the family and reconnect with friends from my early days in XR, including some familiar faces from the Oculus LaunchPad. These kinds of events bring together both the professional and personal sides of my journey, making it even more meaningful.

I also formed new relationships in the XR world that I’m excited to grow. One of the most intriguing conversations I had was about an immersive innovation building at Arizona State, which I hear is a standout in immersive experiences. I’m already planning a visit to see it for myself soon.

The MIT XR Hackathon reminded me of why I got into this field and renewed my drive to keep exploring, creating, and connecting. I’m looking forward to bringing everything I’ve gained here back to my own projects and pushing the boundaries of what XR can offer.
