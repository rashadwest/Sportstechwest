## 🎯 WHAT IS GAME EMBEDDING?

### Simple Answer (ELI10):

**Without Embedding (Now):**
- You click a link → Leave the website → Go to different page → Enter password → Play game
- **Like:** Having to leave your house, walk to a friend's house, knock on the door, then play together

**With Embedding (What We Want):**
- You click "Play Game" button → Game appears on SAME page → Play immediately!
- **Like:** Your friend comes to YOUR house, you play together right there!

## 💡 THE ANALOGY

### Going to a Friend's House (Current):
1. You're at home (on book page)
2. You call friend (click link)
3. You leave your house (navigate away)
4. You walk to friend's house (load new page)
5. You knock on door (enter password)
6. You go inside (game loads)
7. Finally, you play! (game starts)

**Problem:** Too many steps, you left your house!

### Friend Comes to Your House (With Embedding):
1. You're at home (on book page)
2. You call friend (click button)
3. Friend comes to YOUR house (game appears on same page)
4. You play together immediately! (game loads instantly)

**Benefit:** One click, no leaving, instant play!

## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS (Technical - Optional)

### Technical Explanation:
- **iframe:** Like a window that shows another website
- **Embedding:** Put the game inside the book page
- **Same Page:** Game appears without leaving
- **Seamless:** Feels like part of the book page

### Example:
```html
<!-- On Book 1 page -->
<button onclick="playGame()">Play Game</button>

<!-- Game appears here -->
<iframe src="ballcode.co/play?book=1" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
```

**Result:** Game shows up on the same page, no navigation needed!
