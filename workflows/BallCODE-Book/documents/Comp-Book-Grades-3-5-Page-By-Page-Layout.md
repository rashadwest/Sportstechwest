# Comp Book (Grades 3–5) — Page-by-Page Layout (Scaffold)
**Purpose:** Page-by-page layout so you can write what’s needed (no story text included here).  
**Format target (from Dr. Tran Friday package):** **12–20 pages**, mostly images, **1–3 lines of text per page**.  
**Rhythm:** **Story Page → Skill Pit‑Stop Page → Try‑It Page** (repeat).  
**Hard rule:** **You write all story text.** This file only provides placeholders + prompts.

---

## Global Page Rules (keep consistent)
- **Text limit:** 1–3 short lines (grades 3–5)
- **Always show the “BallCODE sentence” on Skill Pit‑Stop pages** (one canonical block sequence)
- **Try‑It pages:** screenshot + “what to click” + “success looks like”
- **Program validity reminder (kid-friendly):** Always `Start` … always finish with `Bucket(ShotType)`
- **Curriculum pathway (must appear at least once):**
  - **Phase 1 (Blocks):** BallCODE blocks
  - **Phase 2 (Bridge):** Blocks ↔ Python (simple 1:1 mapping)
  - **Phase 3 (Python):** a tiny “peek” Python version (read-only for grades 3–5)
