## PHASE 1: CLEAR Framework (Book-Specific)

### C - Clarity: Book Objectives

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is the book's learning objective? (What concept is taught?)
- What is the target age group? (Grades 3-5, 6-8, 9-12)
- What basketball situation is the framework? (Not the subject, but the vehicle)
- What coding/math/AI concept emerges from basketball? (Concept taught through story)
- What is the story structure? (3-act, episodic, chapter-based)

**Book-Specific Clarity:**
- **Basketball = Framework** (not the subject)
- **AI + Math + Coding = What Students Learn** (the subject)
- Story starts with basketball action (not concept explanation)
- Concepts emerge FROM basketball needs
- Basketball success = proof of concept mastery

### L - Logic: Story Structure

**Questions to Ask:**
- How does this story build on previous books? (Progression, prerequisites)
- What is the systematic concept progression? (Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3)
- How do concepts layer on each other? (Foundation → Application → Mastery)
- What is the logical story flow? (Act I → Act II → Act III)
- How does code integrate into the story? (Visual, natural, readable)

**Book-Specific Logic:**
- **Layer 1:** Basketball foundation (action, problem, goal)
- **Layer 2:** Concept emergence (need → discovery → understanding)
- **Layer 3:** Application (using concept to solve basketball problem)
- **Layer 4:** Mastery (success proves understanding)
- **Layer 5:** Integration (code visible, readable, copyable)

### E - Examples: Book Case Studies

**Questions to Ask:**
- What similar educational stories work well? (Case studies, examples)
- What basketball scenarios illustrate concepts? (Real game situations)
- What visual code presentations are effective? (Holograms, thought bubbles, AR)
- What story structures engage students? (Adventure, problem-solving, discovery)

**Book-Specific Examples:**
- Previous BallCODE books (what worked, what didn't)
- Educational storybooks (Magic School Bus, etc.)
- Basketball game situations (real scenarios, authentic problems)
- Code visualization (floating holograms, thought bubbles, game displays)

### A - Adaptation: Story Flexibility

**Questions to Ask:**
- What constraints exist? (Word count, page count, complexity)
- What flexibility is needed? (Age-appropriate language, visual vs. text)
- How do we adapt for different age groups? (Simpler language, more visuals)
- What feedback from previous books should we incorporate? (What worked, what didn't)

**Book-Specific Adaptation:**
- Age-appropriate language (Grades 3-5 vs. 9-12)
- Visual vs. text balance (younger = more visuals)
- Code complexity (simpler for younger, advanced for older)
- Story length (shorter for younger, longer for older)

### R - Results: Book Success Metrics

**Questions to Ask:**
- How do we measure story engagement? (Completion rate, time spent)
- How do we measure concept learning? (Assessment, understanding)
- How do we measure code integration success? (Code readability, copyability)
- How do we measure visual effectiveness? (Image clarity, code visibility)

**Book-Specific Results:**
- **Engagement Metrics:**
  - Story completion rate: >70%
  - Average reading time: Appropriate for age group
  - Return rate: >60%
- **Learning Metrics:**
  - Concept understanding: >75%
  - Code recognition: >80%
  - Application success: >70%
- **Integration Metrics:**
  - Code readability: 100% (all code clearly visible)
  - Code copyability: 100% (all code easily extractable)
  - Visual clarity: >90% (images clear, code readable)

- Ensure code matches story context

### Layer 4: Story Resolution
**Focus:** Basketball success proves concept mastery
- Apply concept to solve basketball problem
- Achieve basketball success
- Prove concept understanding through success
- Connect learning to real-world application
- Create satisfying story conclusion

### Layer 5: Educational Integration
**Focus:** Learning objectives, assessment, curriculum
- Align with curriculum standards
- Connect to game exercises
- Provide assessment opportunities
- Link to grade-level progression

## PHASE 4: Expert Consultation (Book-Specific)

### Chao Zhang (Story-First Approach)
**Questions:**
- "Would Zhang start with basketball action, not concept explanation?"
- "Would Zhang make concepts emerge from basketball needs?"
- "Would Zhang use basketball as the framework, not the subject?"

**Application:**
- Story-first approach (basketball action before concept)
- Natural concept emergence (from basketball needs)
- Basketball as framework (not subject being taught)

### Mitchel Resnick (Constructionist Activities)
**Questions:**
- "Would Resnick have students build something with the code?"
- "Would Resnick make code visible and copyable?"
- "Would Resnick ensure code is part of the learning activity?"

**Application:**
- Code is buildable (students can use it)
- Code is visible (clearly displayed)
- Code is actionable (part of learning activity)

### Reggio Emilia (Multiple Entry Points)
**Questions:**
- "Would Reggio provide multiple ways to engage with the story?"
- "Would Reggio ensure visual and text work together?"
- "Would Reggio make the story accessible to all learners?"

**Application:**
- Multiple entry points (visual, text, code, action)
- Visual and text integration (images support story)
- Accessibility (all learners can engage)
