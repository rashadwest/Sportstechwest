# Daily Website Build Plan
## Story Implementation System - Day by Day

**Purpose:** Build understanding and implement Episode 1 story system through daily questions, tasks, and feedback loops  
**Main Goal:** Get Episode 1 story live and functional on ballcode.co by Tuesday meeting  
**Approach:** Start with questions (Phase A), then tasks (Phase B), then combined (Phase C)

## Phase A: Daily Questions (Days 1-2)
*Building understanding through research and questions*

### Day 1 Questions (Today)

**Research Questions:**
1. What is the current ballcode.co website structure?

2. What are the technical requirements for Episode 1 page?
   - What hosting/deployment method is used?
   - What file structure should we follow?
   - Are there existing templates or components we should use?

3. What content do we have ready for Episode 1?
   - Story content (all 3 acts) - ✅ Ready
   - Skill Pit-Stop content - ✅ Ready

   - What additional content is needed?

4. What makes story implementation "easy" for future episodes?

## Notes

- This plan is separate from the main plan (episode-1-website-launch.plan.md)
- Main plan tracks the big goal (Episode 1 live by Tuesday)
- This plan tracks the daily process (questions → tasks → combined)
- Both plans work together but serve different purposes

**Status:** Phase A - Day 1 (Starting Today)  
**Next Action:** Begin Day 1 questions and research
