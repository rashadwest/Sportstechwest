# IBM Partnership: Two Platforms, One Strategy

**BTE Analytics + BallCODE: Data Partner + Gaming Partner**

## The Opportunity

**IBM's Challenge:** You need basketball statistics/data AND a way to engage kids in STEM education—but you don't have systems that do both.

**Our Solution:** We have two platforms that work together:
1. **BTE Analytics** - Basketball statistics, data, and analytics (data partner)
2. **BallCODE** - Storytelling game that teaches kids through sports (gaming partner)

**The Leverage:** We're the only platform that combines real basketball data with engaging educational games. IBM gets both data AND a way to work with kids.
