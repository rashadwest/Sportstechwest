2. **Click:** "New repository secret"
3. **If you got a license file:**
   - Name: `UNITY_LICENSE`
   - Value: Paste entire contents of `.ulf` file

5. **Click:** "Add secret"

### **Step 3: Open Project in Unity 2021.3.45f2**

**This upgrades the project automatically:**

**This updates `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` automatically.**

### **Step 4: Push Workflow Update**
