# Quick Answer: Can New Site/Game Elements Be Developed in 2 Days?

## Short Answer

**Website improvements: ✅ YES** (2-4 hours)  
**Game development: ❌ NO** (but not needed for IBM demo)

---

## What CAN Be Done ✅

### 1. Website Deployment (2 hours)
- Deploy Episode 1 page to ballcode.co
- Fix contact info, navigation
- Test and verify
- **Result:** Live, working Episode 1 website for demo

### 2. Visual Assets (2-4 hours)
- Generate 3 visuals using AI
- Add to presentation
- **Result:** Professional presentation visuals

### 3. Presentation Deck (1-2 hours)
- Convert content to slides
- Add visuals
- **Result:** Complete presentation ready

**Total: 5-8 hours of work - Very doable in 2 days**

## What CANNOT Be Done ❌

### Game Exercise Development
- **Time needed:** 1-2 weeks (with developer)
- **Complexity:** Requires Unity development, testing, deployment
- **Feasibility:** Not possible in 2 days

## Smart Demo Strategy

### ✅ Show This:
1. **Episode 1 Website (Live)**
   - Complete story content
   - Skill Pit-Stop
   - Exercises section
   - QR codes

2. **Content Materials**
   - Story document
   - Teacher guide
   - Curriculum structure

3. **Game Vision (Explain)**
   - Show integration specs
   - Explain how it will work
   - Emphasize readiness to build

### ❌ Don't Show:
- Working game exercise (not ready)
- Full game integration (not needed)

## What to Say About Game

**If asked about game:**
"The game integration is fully specified and ready to build. Episode 1 will have a state-tracking exercise in Mathlete mode. The Unity project exists, the specs are complete, and we're ready to build it. This would be the next development phase, and we'd love to explore how IBM could support that."

**Key message:** Content is ready. Game is specified. Ready for partnership and development.
