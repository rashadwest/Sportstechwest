As a former [athlete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete) turned tech entrepreneur, Iâ€™ve had my share of unforgettable moments on and off the court. But my trip to the [Paris Olympics](https://olympics.com/en/) this year was an extraordinary milestone. It was more than just an event it was a pivotal moment in my journey with **BTE Analytics** and our mission to revolutionize [data equity](https://data.org/resources/what-is-data-equity-and-why-does-it-matter/#:~:text=the%20Ford%20Foundation.-,Data%20Equity%20is%20a%20set%20of%20principles%20and%20practices%20to,justice%2C%20equity%2C%20and%20inclusivity.) for athletes.

Let me break it down for you.

### Breaking Bread with Olympians

Being surrounded by the worldâ€™s most elite athletes at the [USA House](https://teamusa.org/USA-House) reminded me why I started this journey. Over two days, I had the privilege of meeting iconic figures like [Maverick Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maverick_Carter) and [Paul Rivera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulrivera/) while walking in Paris. We discussed everything from sports to **business**, life, and the importance of venturing beyond the field.

These conversations reinforced my belief in empowering athletes with tools to redefine success whether itâ€™s through [sports tech](https://sporttech.io/) or life off the field. Stories of triumph and challenges alike echoed the importance of our mission at **BTE Analytics**.

### Witnessing History in the Making

I had the once in a lifetime opportunity to attend the gold medal match between [USA](https://www.usoc.org/) and [Brazil](https://www.cbf.com.br/), where the legendary [Marta](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/meet-marta-the-record-breaking-brazilian-football-player/UAWxrX7MR4XIfg?hl=en) played her final Olympic game. The story of how I got there thanks to a last minute invitation from a [VC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp) is one for another day, but that match was more than historic.

It was a catalyst for discussions on [tech industry trends](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology), [go to market strategies](https://www.coursera.org/articles/go-to-market-strategy), and how innovative [business models](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businessmodel.asp) are transforming sports tech. These insights are already shaping the direction of **BTE Analytics**, helping us better serve athletes globally.

### Building Bridges

A key highlight of this trip was engaging with members of the [Olympic Committee](https://olympics.com/ioc) and organizers for the upcoming [LA Olympics](https://la28.org/). These meetings werenâ€™t just about networking they were about shaping the future of sports.

Thereâ€™s a clear demand for solutions that empower athletes through [performance data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_analytics). These connections will be instrumental in advancing our mission to give athletes more control over their data and its monetization.

### Olympians and Fans A Shared Energy

From meeting [Breanna Stewart](https://www.wnba.com/player/breanna-stewart)â€™s parents (who secured me an extra ticket huge thanks to them!) to cycling through [Paris](https://en.parisinfo.com/) and celebrating with fans, the energy at the Olympics was unmatched.

I also had the chance to connect with incredible athletes like the US volleyball silver medalists, [track and field star Rachel Glenn](https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/7556741/), and [Reggie Jaggers III](https://www.teamusa.org/). Listening to their stories deepened my understanding of what athletes truly need not just during their careers, but long after.

### Athlete Soul

One of the standout moments was attending the [Athlete Soul](https://www.theathleticsoul.org/) event and hearing from my friend and former Olympian, [Mikel Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Thomas). His talk was more than inspiring it was a wake up call.

Athletes need platforms like **BTE Analytics** that focus on their equity, their data, and their futures.

### What This Means for BTE Analytics

This trip wasnâ€™t just monumental for me personally it marked a turning point for **BTE Analytics**. The conversations I had and the relationships I built reaffirmed our mission: leveling the playing field for athletes and ensuring they have a seat at the table when it comes to monetizing their talent and data.

Our discussions with the [Olympic Committee](https://olympics.com/ioc) and [LA Olympics](https://la28.org/) organizers opened doors to expand our impact. The insights I gained from Olympians and industry leaders will help us refine our platform to create more opportunities for athletes worldwide.

As I reflect on this unforgettable experience, Iâ€™m more motivated than ever. **BTE Analytics** is not just a tech company itâ€™s a movement. And this trip to Paris reminded me why we do what we do.

Stay tuned thereâ€™s more to come. Maybe next time, Iâ€™ll even share the story about that VC and the gold medal game. ðŸ˜‰
