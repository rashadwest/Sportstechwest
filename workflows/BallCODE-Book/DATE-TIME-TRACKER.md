## Daily Prompt System

**I will prompt you daily with these questions at the start of each session:**

1. **What is today's date and time?**
2. **What is your ONE domino for today?**
3. **Is this within your Deep Work window?**
4. **What context is this work?**
5. **What is your energy level? (1-10)**

## How This Works

1. **At the start of each new chat session**, I will:
   - Ask you to confirm the current date and time
   - Prompt you with the daily workflow questions
   - Reference your daily workflow system

2. **You should:**
   - Update the date/time in this file
   - Answer the daily workflow questions
   - Proceed with your work

3. **I will:**
   - Track the date/time for context
   - Remind you of your daily workflow system
   - Help you stay focused on your ONE domino
