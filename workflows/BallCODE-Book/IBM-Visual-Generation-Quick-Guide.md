# IBM Teaser - Visual Generation Quick Guide

**Goal:** Generate 3 visual assets for Saturday presentation  
**Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Tools:** AI image generation (Glif, DALL-E, Midjourney)

---

## The 3 Visuals You Need

1. **Court Map** - Shows basketball + tech fusion
2. **Shadow Press Scouts** - Shows characters/villains
3. **State Diagram** - Shows coding concept

---

## Option 1: Glif (Recommended - Free & Fast)

### Step 1: Go to glif.app
- Sign up (free tier available)
- Create new generation

### Step 2: Generate Court Map
**Prompt:**
```
Basketball court diagram showing center circle, transition lanes, and half-court line. Stylized with subtle tech/digital elements - grid lines, code-like patterns, blue accents. Clean, modern, kid-friendly illustration. Top-down view.
```

**Settings:**
- Style: Modern illustration
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 4:3
- Generate and download

### Step 3: Generate Shadow Press Scouts
**Prompt:**
```
Shadowy basketball players, dark shifting figures with tech/code elements visible in their shadows. Menacing but kid-friendly villains. Multiple figures (3-5) creating chaos on a basketball court. Dark colors (black, dark gray, dark purple) with subtle blue tech accents. Athletic, lean silhouettes. Cool video game enemy aesthetic, not scary.
```

**Settings:**
- Style: Character illustration
- Aspect ratio: Square (1:1)
- Generate and download

### Step 4: Generate State Diagram
**Prompt:**
```
Flowchart diagram showing four basketball states: START, LIVE, DEAD, OUTCOME. Color-coded boxes with basketball icons. Arrows showing state transitions. Clean, educational, kid-friendly design. Modern flowchart aesthetic with basketball theme.
```

**Settings:**
- Style: Educational diagram
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 4:3
- Generate and download

**Time:** ~30-60 minutes per image = 2-3 hours total

---

## Option 2: DALL-E (OpenAI)

### Step 1: Go to chat.openai.com
- Use DALL-E 3 (if available)
- Or use DALL-E through API

### Step 2: Use Same Prompts
- Copy prompts from above
- Generate images
- Download results

**Cost:** ~$0.04-0.08 per image = ~$0.12-0.24 total

**Time:** ~15-30 minutes per image = 1-2 hours total

---

## Option 3: Midjourney

### Step 1: Join Midjourney Discord
- Subscribe if needed
- Use `/imagine` command

### Step 2: Use Prompts with Midjourney Style
Add Midjourney parameters:
- `--style raw` (for more control)
- `--ar 16:9` (aspect ratio)
- `--v 6` (version 6)

**Example:**
```
/imagine prompt: Basketball court diagram showing center circle, transition lanes, and half-court line. Stylized with subtle tech/digital elements - grid lines, code-like patterns, blue accents. Clean, modern, kid-friendly illustration. Top-down view. --style raw --ar 16:9 --v 6
```

**Time:** ~20-40 minutes per image = 1-2 hours total

---

## After Generation

### Step 1: Download Images
- Save as high-resolution PNG
- Name files clearly:
  - `court_map.png`
  - `shadow_press_scouts.png`
  - `state_diagram.png`

### Step 2: Add to Presentation
- Insert into Slide 5 (Episode 1 Preview)
- Or create separate visual slides

### Step 3: Add to Episode 1 Document
- Can integrate into Episode 1 for full demo
- Or use in handouts

---

## If No Time for Visuals

### Quick Alternative:
1. Use placeholder text in presentation
2. Describe visuals verbally during presentation
3. Generate visuals after Saturday
4. Send visuals as follow-up

**Example Placeholder:**
```
[Visual: Basketball court diagram with tech elements showing center circle and transition lanes]
```

---

## Quality Check

Before using in presentation:

- [ ] Images are clear and professional
- [ ] Colors match BallCODE theme (blue/orange)
- [ ] Kid-friendly (not scary or inappropriate)
- [ ] High enough resolution for presentation
- [ ] Files are properly named and organized

---

## File Organization

Save images in:
```
automated_outputs/
└── visuals/
    ├── court_map.png
    ├── shadow_press_scouts.png
    └── state_diagram.png
```
