## 📖 BOOK 4: THE EVENT TRIGGER

**Title:** The Event Trigger (or "The Shot Clock")  
**Dribble Level:** 4 (Between the Legs)  
**Word Count:** 1,200-1,800 words  
**Target:** Grades 3-8

---

## 🎯 CORE CONCEPT

### **Primary Concept: Events and Triggers**
- **Basketball:** Game events (shot clock, timeout, foul) trigger actions
- **Coding:** Events trigger code execution
- **AI:** Event-driven systems respond to triggers
- **Math:** Conditional events and probability

### **Basketball Context:**
- Shot clock counting down → triggers urgency
- Timeout called → triggers strategy change
- Foul committed → triggers free throw
- Quarter ends → triggers break

---

## 📐 STORY STRUCTURE (3 Acts)

### **ACT I: The Shot Clock Crisis (~450 words)**

#### **Opening Scene:**
- Game situation: Shot clock running down
- Nova has the ball, needs to act
- **Problem:** No clear trigger for when to shoot
- **Stakes:** Shot clock violation = turnover

#### **Character Introduction:**
- **Nova:** Confused about when to act
- **Arc:** "Event detection needed. Trigger system required."
- **Coach Circuit:** "Events trigger actions. Shot clock is an event."

#### **Inciting Incident:**
- Shot clock hits 5 seconds → triggers urgency
- Nova panics, makes bad decision
- Arc: "Event-driven system needed. React to triggers."
- Coach: "Learn to respond to events, not just act randomly."

---

### **ACT II: Learning Event-Driven Thinking (~550 words)**

#### **Rising Action:**
- Multiple game events occur (shot clock, timeout, foul)
- Nova tries to react but doesn't understand triggers
- **Struggle:** How do events trigger actions?

#### **Learning Moments:**

**1. Simple Events (Scaffolding):**
- Button clicks (in game UI)
- Shot clock hits certain number
- Ball passed to player
- **Visual:** See event → action connection
- **Scaffolding:** Start with one event, add complexity

**2. Complex Events:**
- Multiple events happening simultaneously
- Event sequencing (event A triggers event B)
- Event conditions (if event X AND event Y, then action)
- **Scaffolding:** Build complexity gradually

**3. Real-World Events:**
- Alarms (wake up, class bell)
- Notifications (phone, email)
- Game events (timeout, foul, substitution)
- **Connection:** Events are everywhere

#### **Basketball Events:**
- **Game Events:** Shot clock, timeout, quarter end
- **Player Events:** Foul, substitution, injury
- **Team Events:** Timeout, strategy change
- **Court Events:** In paint, at three-point line, out of bounds

#### **Struggle:**
- Nova: "Too many events! How do I know which to respond to?"
- Coach: "Prioritize. Some events are more important than others."
- Arc: "Event hierarchy needed. Critical events first."

#### **Turning Point:**
- Nova understands: "Events trigger actions. I need to listen for triggers."
- Connection: "Like a doorbell - when it rings (event), I answer (action)."

---

### **ACT III: Event-Driven Success (~500 words)**

#### **Climax:**
- Final seconds, shot clock running down
- Multiple events happening (timeout available, defender closing, teammate open)
- **Challenge:** Which event to respond to?

#### **Event-Driven Solution:**
- Arc: "Event priority: Shot clock critical, defender secondary, teammate tertiary."
- Nova: "So I respond to the most important event first?"
- Coach: "Yes. Event-driven thinking: React to triggers in order of importance."

#### **Basketball Success:**
- Shot clock hits 3 seconds → triggers urgency
- Nova responds: Passes to open teammate (responds to teammate event)
- Teammate scores before shot clock expires
- **Success:** Event-driven thinking works!

#### **Resolution:**
- Nova reflects: "Events trigger actions. I need to listen and respond."
- Connection: "Coding uses events too - when button clicked, code runs."
- Future: "Now I can respond to any event in the game!"

## 🎓 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

### **Primary Objectives:**
1. Understand that events trigger actions
2. Identify different types of events
3. Create event-driven code using blocks
4. See connection between event blocks and Python event listeners
5. Write Python event-driven code

### **Secondary Objectives:**
1. Understand event priority
2. Create event sequences
3. Connect events to real-world situations
4. Design event-driven systems

---

## 🎮 GAME INTEGRATION

### **Phase 1: Block Coding**
```
WHEN [shot clock < 5] DO [shoot or pass]
WHEN [ball passed to me] DO [catch ball]
WHEN [defender closes] DO [pass to open teammate]
WHEN [timeout called] DO [go to bench]
```

### **Phase 2: Transition Bridge**
```
Block: WHEN [event] DO [action]
Code:  on_event(lambda: action())
```

### **Phase 3: Python Learning**
```python
def game_events():
    on_shot_clock_low(lambda: shoot_or_pass())
    on_ball_passed(lambda: catch_ball())
    on_defender_closes(lambda: pass_to_open_teammate())
    on_timeout(lambda: go_to_bench())
```
