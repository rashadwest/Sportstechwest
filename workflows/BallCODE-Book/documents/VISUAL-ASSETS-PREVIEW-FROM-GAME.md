## 🎨 WHAT EACH VISUAL SHOULD LOOK LIKE

Based on your game screenshots and descriptions, here's what each visual asset should show:

---

### **1. COURT MAP VISUAL** 🏀

**What It Should Show:**
- **Basketball court** with grid pattern (like your game)
- **Center circle** prominently displayed
- **Grid overlay** (like your Tutorial mode)
- **Tech elements** (subtle circuit patterns or code symbols)
- **Colors:** Orange (#eb6123) and blue (#0C72B3) - your game colors

**Based on Your Game:**
- Your `Main Menu.png` shows: "Outdoor basketball court at dusk/night with grid pattern"
- Your `Tutorial mode.png` shows: "Dark grey basketball court with white grid overlay"
- Your `BallCODE section.png` shows: "Grid court with red and teal players"

**Best Match from Your Game:**
- Use a screenshot showing the **grid court** (like Tutorial mode or Main Menu)
- Crop/focus on the **center circle area**
- This shows students WHERE the story happens

**Visual Style:**
```

### **2. SHADOW PRESS SCOUTS CHARACTER ART** 👥

**What It Should Show:**
- **Basketball player/robot** in defensive stance
- **Dark blue/navy uniform** (the "villains" team)
- **Defensive pose** (ready to press, create chaos)
- **Determined expression** (focused, challenging)
- **Game-style robot** (matches your game's robot characters)

**Based on Your Game:**
- Your `Tutorial_1.png` through `Tutorial_17.png` show game robots/players
- Your `Coding_Gameplay_1.png` shows player characters
- Your robots are: Red, Teal, Blue - use the **opposing team** color (dark blue/navy)

**Best Match from Your Game:**
- Use a screenshot showing **defensive robots/players** (opposing team)
- Crop to focus on **one or two characters** in defensive stance
- This shows students WHO the "villains" are

**Visual Style:**
```

- **Arrows** showing transitions between states
- **Game-style design** (matches your game's visual style)
- **Colors:** Orange (#eb6123) and blue (#0C72B3)

**Based on Your Game:**
- Your `Coding_Gameplay_1.png` shows coding blocks (could represent states)
- Your game uses **block coding** - states could be shown as blocks
- Your game has **state management** (possession states)

**Best Match from Your Game:**
- Use a screenshot showing **coding blocks** (represents state logic)
- OR: Create a simple diagram using **game colors and style**
- This shows students HOW the coding concept works

**Visual Style:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│    START ──→ LIVE ──→ DEAD ──→     │

## 🎯 HOW TO GET THESE FROM YOUR GAME

### **Option 1: Use Existing Screenshots** (5-10 minutes)

1. **Open:** `/Users/rashadwest/Desktop/BallCODE screenshots/`
2. **For Court Map:** Use `Main Menu.png` or `Tutorial_1.png` - crop to center circle
3. **For Shadow Press Scouts:** Use `Tutorial_1.png` through `Tutorial_17.png` - find defensive robots
4. **For State Diagram:** Use `Coding_Gameplay_1.png` OR create simple diagram with game colors

### **Option 2: Take New Screenshots** (10-15 minutes)

1. **Open your game** at `ballcode.netlify.app`
2. **For Court Map:** Go to Tutorial mode, screenshot the court showing center circle
3. **For Shadow Press Scouts:** Go to a level with defensive robots, screenshot them
4. **For State Diagram:** Go to Coding mode, screenshot the block interface OR create diagram

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

1. **I'll create a script** to help you select and copy the right screenshots
2. **You choose** which screenshots work best for each visual
3. **Script copies** them to `BallCode/assets/images/`
4. **Automation adds** them to the website

**Much faster and uses your actual game visuals!** 🎮
