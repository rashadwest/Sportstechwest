# BallCODE Game Level Mechanics Analysis

**Purpose:** Document how each game level works, starting with the tutorial as the foundation.

**Last Updated:** December 2025

---

## Core Game Mechanics (From Documentation)

### Block System
- **START Block** - Begins the sequence
- **DRIBBLE Blocks** - Action blocks with clock timing (can be chained)
- **BUCKET Block** - Shoot/complete the sequence

### UI Elements (From Game-Analysis-Questions.md)
- Basketball court with grid overlay
- Block code area (top right corner)
- Generated code display (below block code)
- Magnifying glass (left corner) - shows video playback
- Dribble tree system (needs update to 7 dribbles)
- Navigation: House (menu), Reverse (back), Delete

### Learning Progression
1. **Level 1:** Simple Sequences (START → DRIBBLE → BUCKET)
2. **Level 2:** Multiple Dribbles (Chain multiple dribbles)
3. **Level 3:** Clock Timing (Understand timing and sequencing)
4. **Level 4:** Conditionals (If/then logic with basketball reads)
5. **Level 5:** Loops (Repetitive actions/rotations)
6. **Level 6:** Python (Write Python code for same sequences)
