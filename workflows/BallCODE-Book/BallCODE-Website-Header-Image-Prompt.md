## 🎨 COMPLETE IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

### Primary Prompt (Use This Exact Text):

```
A clean futuristic basketball court at night, outdoor court with visible stars twinkling in the dark night sky above. 4-5 diverse young children (ages 8-12) playing basketball in blue t-shirts and shorts, some dribbling glowing neon blue basketballs. Dark basketball court surface with subtle glowing neon blue lines marking boundaries, key, and free-throw lines. Two basketball hoops with backboards visible on left and right sides, both softly outlined in glowing neon blue.

Nighttime atmosphere with clear starry sky visible in the background. Minimal purposeful holographic elements: one or two subtle holographic displays floating above the court showing geometric patterns or simple data visualizations in neon blue and orange. A single glowing basketball trajectory line or movement path in neon blue. Very clean composition, not cluttered, purposeful design elements only.

Color palette: Deep dark blue night sky (#0A0E27) with visible white stars, black court surface (#000000), bright neon blue (#00D4FF, #0099FF) for court lines and holograms, vibrant orange (#FF6B35) accents on holographic elements, pure white (#FFFFFF) for stars and highlights. Minimal color usage, clean and purposeful.
