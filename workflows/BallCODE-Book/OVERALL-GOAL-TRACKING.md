## ⚠️ Critical Blockers & Dependencies

### Immediate Blockers
1. **Visual Assets (0%)** - Blocks Episode 1 completion, website updates, IBM presentation
2. **Book Production (0%)** - Blocks revenue generation, target school outreach
3. **Paywall System (0%)** - Blocks revenue generation

### Dependencies
- **Books 1-3** → Must complete before Books 4-7 (workflow establishment)
- **Paywall System** → Must complete before revenue generation
- **Content Quality** → Must meet standards before target school outreach
- **Visual Assets** → Needed for Episode 1, but not blocking book production

### Risk Mitigation
- **Visual Assets:** Can proceed with books without visuals (videos don't need static images)
- **Unity Integration:** Can launch books standalone, integrate later
- **Website Updates:** Can use simple pages initially, enhance later

---

## 📅 Timeline & Deadlines

### This Week
- **Today:** Books 1-3 complete (written, recorded, uploaded)

## 📊 Overall Goal Health Check

**Current Status:** 🟡 **35% Complete**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Planning and documentation complete (100%)
- ✅ Content creation process established (95%)
- ✅ Episode 1 story complete (100%)
- ✅ Clear production workflow defined

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Book production not started (0%)
- ❌ Paywall system not implemented (0%)
