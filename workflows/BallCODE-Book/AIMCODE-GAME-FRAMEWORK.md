## PHASE 1: CLEAR Framework (Game-Specific)

### C - Clarity: Game Objectives

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is the game's learning objective? (What concept is taught?)
- What is the target age group? (Grades 3-5, 6-8, 9-12)
- What basketball situation is the game framework? (Game scenario, challenge)
- What coding/math/AI concept is exercised? (Concept practiced through gameplay)
- What is the game structure? (Exercise-based, level-based, story-based)

**Game-Specific Clarity:**
- **Basketball = Framework** (game scenario, not the subject)
- **AI + Math + Coding = What Students Learn** (concepts practiced)
- Game exercises concept through basketball gameplay
- Code is visible and actionable in game
- Game success = proof of concept understanding

### L - Logic: Game Structure

**Questions to Ask:**
- How does this game connect to the book? (Specific book, specific concept)
- How does this game connect to Python? (Code translation, application)
- What is the exercise progression? (Easy → Medium → Hard)
- How do game mechanics teach concepts? (Through gameplay, not explanation)
- What is the code integration method? (Visual blocks, Python display, both)

**Game-Specific Logic:**
- **Layer 1:** Game foundation (basketball scenario, challenge, goal)
- **Layer 2:** Concept exercise (practicing concept through gameplay)
- **Layer 3:** Code integration (blocks visible, Python connection shown)
- **Layer 4:** Mastery demonstration (game success proves understanding)
- **Layer 5:** Curriculum integration (book → game → Python flow)

### E - Examples: Game Case Studies

**Questions to Ask:**
- What educational games work well? (Scratch, Code.org games, Khan Academy)
- What game mechanics teach concepts effectively? (Puzzle-solving, building, creating)

- Code visualization (blocks, Python, comparison)

### A - Adaptation: Game Flexibility

**Questions to Ask:**
- What constraints exist? (Unity limitations, performance, complexity)
- What flexibility is needed? (Different difficulty levels, hints, support)
- How do we adapt for different age groups? (Simpler mechanics, more guidance)
- What feedback should we incorporate? (Player needs, teacher feedback, assessment)

**Game-Specific Adaptation:**
- Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Hints and support (scaffolding, guidance, examples)
- Age-appropriate mechanics (simpler for younger, complex for older)
- Multiple solutions (different ways to solve, creativity)

### R - Results: Game Success Metrics

**Questions to Ask:**
- How do we measure game engagement? (Play time, completion rate, return rate)
- How do we measure concept learning? (Exercise success, code application)
- How do we measure code integration success? (Code usage, Python transition)
- How do we measure player experience? (Fun, engagement, learning)

**Game-Specific Results:**
- **Engagement Metrics:**
  - Exercise completion rate: >75%
  - Average play time: Appropriate for exercise
  - Return rate: >60%
- **Learning Metrics:**
  - Exercise success rate: >70%
