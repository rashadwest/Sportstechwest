## Answer Keys

### Exercise A: Label States in a Play

1. START (tip-off begins)
2. LIVE (your team has possession)
3. LIVE (still in play, still your team)
4. DEAD (play stopped, ball out of bounds)
5. LIVE (other team has possession now)
6. OUTCOME (play ended with points scored)

**Scoring:** 1 point per correct answer (6 points total)

### Exercise B: Write State Transitions

**Part 1: Basic Transitions**
```
START → LIVE → DEAD → LIVE → OUTCOME
  ↑                        ↓
  └────────────────────────┘
```

**Explanation:**
- START → LIVE: When someone gets the ball
- LIVE → DEAD: When play stops (out of bounds, foul, etc.)
- DEAD → LIVE: When play resumes
- LIVE → OUTCOME: When the play ends (score, turnover, shot clock)

**Part 2: Create Your Own Play**
- Accept any reasonable play with correct state labels
- Look for: Clear state identification, logical flow, creativity

**Scoring:** 5 points for transitions, 5 points for play creation (10 points total)

### Exercise C: Handle an Edge Case

**Question 1:** C) DEAD
- The play has stopped. No one has clear possession. The state is DEAD.

**Question 2:** A) START
- A jump ball is like a mini tip-off. The state resets to START.

**Question 3:** B) LIVE (us)
- Your team got the ball. You now have possession, so the state is LIVE (us).

**Challenge Question - Example Answers:**
- **Shot clock violation:** LIVE → DEAD → OUTCOME (turnover)
- **Overtime tip-off:** OUTCOME (end of regulation) → START (overtime begins)
- **Technical foul:** LIVE → DEAD → LIVE (free throws) → DEAD → LIVE (play resumes)

**Scoring:** 5 points per question, 5 points for challenge (20 points total)

if state == START:
    wait for tip-off
elif state == LIVE:
    play basketball
elif state == DEAD:
    wait for play to resume
elif state == OUTCOME:
    record result
```

### 3. Create Your Own State System

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: States can be multiple at once
**Correction:** States are exclusive. The game can only be in one state at a time.

### Misconception 2: You can skip states
**Correction:** States must follow transition rules. You can't go from START directly to OUTCOME.

### Misconception 3: LIVE and DEAD are the same
**Correction:** LIVE means the ball is actively in play. DEAD means play has stopped.

### Misconception 4: State tracking is only for basketball
**Correction:** State tracking is used in coding, video games, robotics, and many other areas.
