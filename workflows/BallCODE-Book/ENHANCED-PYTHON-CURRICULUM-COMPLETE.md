## AIMCODE-Aligned Curriculum for IBM & School Presentations

**Copyright © 2025 Rashad West. All Rights Reserved.**

**Date:** December 3, 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive, best-in-class curriculum framework  
**Target:** IBM SkillsBuild integration + STEM school adoption  
**Methodology:** AIMCODE (Zhang, Resnick, Reggio, Hassabis, Jobs)

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**BallCODE teaches Python programming AND math concepts through basketball stories using a research-backed, three-phase learning pathway.**

**CRITICAL:** Basketball is the language/framework for teaching BOTH coding AND math equally. Students learn coding and math THROUGH basketball, not ABOUT basketball.

**What Makes This Curriculum Best-in-Class:**
1. **Story-First Approach** (Zhang) - Concepts emerge from narrative, not explanation
2. **Basketball as Language** (Drazan) - Basketball is the framework for BOTH coding AND math
3. **Constructionist Learning** (Resnick) - Students build to learn, not consume
4. **Multiple Entry Points** (Reggio) - Story, game, code, visual pathways
5. **Systematic Progression** (Hassabis) - Layer-by-layer deep learning
6. **Simple, Beautiful Design** (Jobs) - "It just works" - intuitive and engaging

**Target Audience:** Grades 3-8 (Elementary & Middle School)  
**Format:** 3 books (expanding to 7+), each with story, game exercises, Python progression, AND math application  
**Approach:** 70% story, 30% skill instruction with hands-on practice (for BOTH coding AND math)

---

## 📚 THREE-PHASE LEARNING PATHWAY

### Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding + Math)
**AIMCODE Alignment:** Resnick (Constructionist) + Reggio (Multiple Entry Points) + Drazan (Basketball as Language)

**What Students Do:**
- Learn coding concepts AND math concepts using basketball terminology
- Visual block interface (no typing required)
- Drag blocks together to create programs AND perform math calculations
- Immediate feedback through integrated game exercises

**Coding Concepts Introduced:**
- **Book 1:** Sequences and basic blocks
- **Book 2:** If/then conditionals
- **Book 3:** Loops and repetition

**Math Concepts Introduced:**
- **Book 1:** Counting, basic statistics (points, possessions)
- **Book 2:** Probability, decision-making math
- **Book 3:** Pattern analysis, data interpretation, ratios

**How It Works:**
- **Coding:** Students see blocks like "IF defender goes left, THEN crossover right"
- **Math:** Students see blocks like "CALCULATE best shot probability" or "COUNT points per possession"
- No Python syntax or complex math formulas yet - just concepts through blocks
- Basketball terminology makes BOTH coding AND math accessible to all students
- Multiple ways to engage: visual (blocks), auditory (story), kinesthetic (game)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Students understand coding concepts through familiar basketball language
- Students understand math concepts through familiar basketball language
- Students can create programs using visual blocks
- Students can perform math calculations using visual blocks
- Students see that code is just instructions AND math is just problem-solving
- Students gain confidence before moving to text-based coding AND formal math

**Assessment:**
- Block coding exercises in game
- Story comprehension checks
- Concept understanding questions

---

### Phase 2: Transition Bridge (Coding + Math)

**Math Concepts Reinforced:**
- Same concepts from Phase 1, now with formulas
- Students see: "This block = this math calculation"
- Understanding deepens: "Math is just problem-solving"

**How It Works:**
- **Coding:** Visual comparison: Block on left, Python code on right
  - Students see: `if defender_goes_left: crossover_right()`
- **Math:** Visual comparison: Block on left, math formula on right
  - Students see: `best_shot_probability = calculate_expected_value(shot_data)`
- Connection made: "Oh, this is the same thing!" (for BOTH coding AND math)
- Gradual transition - no pressure to write code or solve complex math yet

**Learning Objectives:**
- Students understand that blocks and code are the same thing
- Students see Python syntax in context
