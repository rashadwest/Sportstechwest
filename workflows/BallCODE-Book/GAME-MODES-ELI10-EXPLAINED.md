## 🎮 GAME MODE 1: BLOCK CODING GAME

### ELI10: What Is It?

**Think of it like building with LEGO blocks, but for basketball moves!**

**How It Works:**
1. **You see blocks on the left** (like a toy box):
   - START block (green) - "Begin here!"
   - DRIBBLE blocks (different colors) - Each is a basketball move
   - BUCKET block (orange) - "Shoot the ball!"

2. **You drag blocks to the middle** (like building a tower):
   - START
   - DRIBBLE 1 (Pound - bounce ball hard)
   - DRIBBLE 2 (Crossover - move ball to other hand)
   - BUCKET (shoot!)

3. **You click "PLAY"** and watch your robot do exactly what you told it!

**The 7 Dribbles:**
- **Dribble 1:** POUND (bounce ball hard, like dribbling fast)
- **Dribble 2:** CROSSOVER (move ball from one hand to the other)
- **Dribble 3:** IN & OUT (fake one way, go the other - tricky!)
- **Dribble 4:** BETWEEN THE LEGS (bounce ball between your legs)
- **Dribble 5:** BEHIND THE BACK (bounce ball behind your back)
- **Dribble 6:** HALF SPIN (turn halfway around)
- **Dribble 7:** SPIN (turn all the way around)

**Each dribble has a CLOCK:**
- Like a timer: "Do this move for 0.5 seconds"
- Blocks happen in order, one after another
- Total time = add up all the clocks

**What You're Learning:**
- How to give step-by-step instructions (sequences)
- How to put things in order
- How code works (blocks = code)

**Example:**
```
START
  ↓
POUND (0.5 seconds)
  ↓
CROSSOVER (0.8 seconds)
  ↓
BUCKET (shoot!)
```

**Result:** Robot pounds ball, crosses over, then shoots!

## 🧮 GAME MODE 2: MATH GAME

### ELI10: What Is It?

**Think of it like a math puzzle, but you use basketball moves to solve it!**

**How It Works:**
1. **You see a target number** at the top (like "90 points")

2. **You see a formula with blanks:**
   ```
   (3 + _ + _) × _ = 90
   ```

3. **Each dribble move has a number value:**
   - POUND = 1 point
   - CROSSOVER = 2 points
   - IN & OUT = 3 points
   - BETWEEN LEGS = 4 points
   - etc.

4. **You pick dribble moves to fill the blanks:**
   - First blank: IN & OUT (3 points)
   - Second blank: IN & OUT (3 points)
   - Third blank: CROSSOVER (2 points)
   - Formula: (3 + 3 + 3) × 2 = 18 (not 90, try again!)

5. **Then you pick a SHOT TYPE:**
   - Close Shot: Your sum × 20 = 18 × 20 = 360 (too high!)
   - Medium Shot: Your sum × 10 = 18 × 10 = 180 (still too high!)
   - Long Shot: Your sum × 5 = 18 × 5 = 90 ✅ (Perfect!)

**What You're Learning:**
- Math (addition, multiplication)
- Problem solving
- How to use numbers to make decisions
- Basketball moves have values (like points)

**Example Problem:**
- Target: 90 points
- Formula: (3 + 3 + 3) × 5 = 45 (not enough!)
- Try: (3 + 3 + 3) × 10 = 90 ✅ (Got it!)

**The Challenge:**
- Find the right combination of moves
- Pick the right shot type
- Hit the target number!

## ♟️ GAME MODE 3: CHESS GAME

### ELI10: What Is It?

**Think of it like chess, but instead of chess pieces, you use basketball moves!**

**How It Works:**
1. **You have numbered basketballs (1-7)** instead of chess pieces
2. **Each number has arrows** showing which way you can move
3. **You take turns** with another player (like chess!)
4. **Goal:** Get to the DUNK (like checkmate!)

**Offensive Strategy (Trying to Score):**
```
START → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → DUNK
```

**What Each Number Does:**
- **1:** Move forward (↓)
- **2:** Move left OR right (← or →)
- **3:** Move left, right, OR forward (← → or ↓↓)
- **4:** Same as 3 (more options)
- **5:** Quick left-left OR right-right (fast crossover!)
- **6:** Jump up (↗ ↖) - getting ready to shoot
- **7:** Drive down (↘ ↙) - going to basket
- **DUNK:** Score! (You win!)

**Defensive Strategy (Trying to Stop Them):**
```
START → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → STEAL or BLOCK
```

**What Each Number Does:**
- **1:** Move up OR down (↑ ↓) - positioning
- **2:** Move left OR right (← →) - side to side
- **3:** Close out (↓ ↘ ↓ ↙) - rush the shooter
- **4:** Same as 3 (more pressure)
- **5:** Hands up! (Ready to block)
- **STEAL or BLOCK:** Stop them! (You win!)

**How to Play:**
- You pick a number (1-7)
- Follow the arrows to move
- Try to get to DUNK (offense) or STEAL/BLOCK (defense)
- Other player tries to stop you
- First to goal wins!

**What You're Learning:**
- Strategy (planning ahead)
- Thinking like your opponent
- Making good decisions
- Basketball tactics

**Future:** Two people on different computers can play against each other!

## 📚 GAME MODE 4: TUTORIAL

### ELI10: What Is It?

**Think of it like a teacher showing you how to do each move, step by step!**

**How It Works:**
1. **The game shows you each dribble** one at a time
2. **It explains what each move does:**
   - "This is POUND - bounce the ball hard"
   - "This is CROSSOVER - move ball to other hand"
   - etc.

3. **You practice each move:**
   - Watch the example
   - Try it yourself
   - Get feedback

4. **You learn all 7 dribbles** in order

**What You're Learning:**
- What each dribble move is
- How to do each move
- The order to learn them (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7)
- Foundation for all other games

**Future Enhancements:**
- Tutorials for each type of shot (layup, jump shot, etc.)
- Tutorials for pivots
- Tutorials for other basketball skills

**Why It's Important:**
- You need to know the moves before playing
- Like learning the alphabet before reading
- Foundation for everything else!

## 🐍 GAME MODE 5: PYTHON CODING GAME (Roadmap)

### ELI10: What Is It?

**Think of it like writing a recipe, but in Python code instead of blocks!**

**How It Works:**
1. **You see a code editor** (like a text box where you type)
2. **You write Python code** using basketball words:
   ```python
   start()
   pound_dribble()
   pound_dribble()
   pound_dribble()
   advance()
   bucket()
   ```

3. **You click "RUN"** and watch your robot do what you coded!

4. **You see your code work** just like the blocks did!

**The Connection:**
- **Blocks:** START → POUND → POUND → POUND → BUCKET
- **Python:** `start()`, `pound_dribble()`, `pound_dribble()`, `pound_dribble()`, `bucket()`
- **Same thing, different language!**

**What You're Learning:**
- How to write Python code
- How blocks = Python code
- Real programming skills
- Basketball terminology in code

**Status:** Roadmap item - 1-2 levels for ideation first
