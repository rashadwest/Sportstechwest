## Critical Gaps for Saturday

### 🔴 GAP #1: Visual Assets (30% Complete)

**Problem:** You have visual briefs but NO actual images. For IBM presentation, visuals are essential to show the concept.

**What's Missing:**
- Court Map visual (shows basketball + tech fusion)
- Shadow Press Scouts visual (shows characters)
- State Diagram visual (shows coding concept)

**Impact:** Without visuals, presentation feels incomplete. Visuals make the concept tangible and professional.

**Quick Solution (2-4 hours):**
1. Use prompts from `automated_outputs/plan2_visual_prompts.json`
2. Generate 3 images using:
   - **Glif** (glif.app) - Free tier, fast
   - **DALL-E** (OpenAI) - Pay per image, high quality
   - **Midjourney** - If you have access
3. Download images
4. Add to presentation or Episode 1 document

**Alternative (If No Time):**
- Use placeholder text in presentation: "Visual: [Court Map showing tech elements]"
- Generate visuals after Saturday
- Focus on story content and demo

---

### 🔴 GAP #2: Presentation Deck

**Problem:** You have documents but no slide deck for presentation.

**What's Needed:**
- 7-10 slide deck covering key points
- Professional appearance
- Clear narrative flow

**Quick Solution (1-2 hours):**
I can create a slide-by-slide outline right now using your existing content. You can then:
1. Create PowerPoint/Keynote from outline
2. Add visuals once generated
3. Practice presentation

**Content Available:**
- All content exists in IBM-One-Pager
- Episode 1 story ready
- Curriculum structure defined

---

### 🟡 GAP #3: Demo Preparation

**Problem:** Website is ready but needs to be accessible for demo.

**What's Needed:**
- Website deployed OR local demo ready
- QR codes printed/tested
- Demo script/talking points

**Quick Solution (30 minutes):**
1. Deploy website page to ballcode.co (if domain ready)
   OR
2. Run local server and demo from laptop
3. Print QR codes (already generated)
4. Test scanning

## Recommended Action Plan (Priority Order)

### TODAY (Highest Priority)

**1. Create Presentation Deck (1-2 hours)**
- I can create slide-by-slide outline now
- You create deck from outline
- Add visuals later (or use placeholders)

**2. Generate 3 Visual Assets (2-4 hours)**
- Use prompts from `automated_outputs/plan2_visual_prompts.json`
- Generate via Glif/DALL-E/Midjourney
- Add to presentation and Episode 1

**3. Prepare Demo (30 minutes)**
- Deploy website OR prepare local demo
- Print QR codes
- Test everything

## What I Can Create Right Now

I can immediately create:

1. **Presentation Deck Outline** - Complete slide-by-slide content
2. **Visual Generation Quick Guide** - Step-by-step to generate 3 images
3. **Demo Script** - Talking points for presentation
4. **Enhanced One-Pager** - Polished version for handouts

---

## Minimal Viable Teaser (If Time is Tight)

If you only have 2-3 hours:

1. **Presentation Deck** (1-2 hours) - Essential
   - Create from IBM One-Pager content
   - Use placeholder text for visuals
   
2. **Website Demo** (30 minutes) - Essential
   - Deploy or local demo
   - Test QR codes
   
3. **Skip Visuals** (for now)
   - Generate after Saturday
   - Use descriptive text in presentation

**Result:** Functional teaser that shows concept, can add visuals later

---

## Full Package (If You Have 4-6 Hours)

1. **Presentation Deck** (1-2 hours)
2. **Generate Visuals** (2-4 hours)
3. **Demo Preparation** (30 minutes)
4. **Practice Run** (30 minutes)

**Result:** Professional teaser with visuals, deck, and demo

---

## Immediate Next Steps

**Would you like me to:**

1. **Create presentation deck outline** (slide-by-slide content)?
2. **Create visual generation guide** (step-by-step instructions)?
3. **Create demo script** (talking points)?
4. **All of the above**?

I can create these right now so you can execute quickly.
