# CLEAR Framework: How to Use It in Prompts

**Purpose:** Guide for using CLEAR framework to create effective prompts and display them properly

---

## Why CLEAR Makes Prompts Work Well

### The Problem Without CLEAR
- **Vague requests** → AI makes assumptions → Wrong output
- **Missing context** → AI fills gaps incorrectly → Needs multiple revisions
- **Unclear objectives** → AI doesn't know what "done" looks like → Incomplete work
- **No structure** → AI works randomly → Inefficient and inconsistent

### The Solution With CLEAR
- **Clear objectives** → AI knows exactly what to do → Right output first time
- **Structured thinking** → AI follows logical progression → Systematic approach
- **Examples provided** → AI understands style/format → Consistent results
- **Adaptation considered** → AI anticipates challenges → More robust solutions
- **Results defined** → AI knows success criteria → Complete work

## How to Use CLEAR in Prompts

### Step 1: Always Start with CLEAR
**Before asking AI to do anything, structure your request using CLEAR:**

```
I need help with [TASK]. Let's use the CLEAR framework:

C - Clarity: [What are the clear objectives?]
L - Logic: [What is the logical approach?]
E - Examples: [What examples illustrate this?]
A - Adaptation: [What flexibility is needed?]
R - Results: [What does success look like?]
```

### Step 2: Fill in Each Component
**Be specific for each letter:**

**C - Clarity:**
- What exactly needs to be done?
- What are the constraints?
- What format is needed?
- Who is the audience?

**L - Logic:**
- What steps should be followed?
- How does this build on previous work?
- What's the systematic approach?
- What order should things happen?

**E - Examples:**
- What similar work exists?
- What style/format should be followed?
- What worked well before?
- What should this look like?

**A - Adaptation:**
- What might go wrong?
- What constraints exist?
- What flexibility is needed?
- What might need to change?

**R - Results:**
- What does "done" look like?
- How will we know it's successful?
- What are the success criteria?
- What metrics matter?

## How to Display CLEAR When Used

### Format 1: Structured Prompt (Recommended)
**Use this format when giving instructions to AI:**

```
## CLEAR Framework

**C - Clarity:**
- Objective: [What needs to be done]
- Constraints: [Limitations or requirements]
- Format: [Expected output format]
- Audience: [Who this is for]

**L - Logic:**
- Approach: [How to structure this]
- Steps: [Order of operations]
- Dependencies: [What this builds on]
- Flow: [Logical progression]

**E - Examples:**
- Reference: [Similar work to follow]
- Style: [Format/style to match]
- Best practices: [What worked before]
- Template: [Format to use]

**A - Adaptation:**
- Constraints: [Limitations to consider]
- Flexibility: [What can change]
- Contingencies: [What if scenarios]
- Adjustments: [Potential modifications]

**R - Results:**
- Success criteria: [What "done" means]
- Metrics: [How to measure success]
- Deliverables: [What will be produced]
- Quality standards: [What good looks like]
```

### Format 2: Question-Based Prompt
**Use this format when you want AI to help you think through the task:**

```
Let's use the CLEAR framework to approach [TASK]:

C - Clarity: What are the clear objectives? What needs to be clearly defined?
L - Logic: What is the logical approach? How do we structure this systematically?
E - Examples: What examples or case studies illustrate this concept?
A - Adaptation: How do we remain flexible? What adaptations might be needed?
R - Results: What are the measurable outcomes? How will we assess success?
```

### Format 3: Checklist Format
**Use this format for quick reference or when working through a task:**

```
## CLEAR Framework Checklist

- [ ] **C - Clarity:** Objectives clearly defined
- [ ] **L - Logic:** Logical approach established
- [ ] **E - Examples:** Relevant examples identified
- [ ] **A - Adaptation:** Flexibility needs assessed
- [ ] **R - Results:** Success criteria defined
```

### Format 4: Visual Display (For Documentation)
**Use this format when documenting the framework for others:**

```

- Framework: Basketball situation (beating a trap)
- Audience: Grades 3-8 students

L - Logic:
- Build on Episode 1 (state management)
- Introduce conditionals through basketball reads
- Follow 3-act structure: Setup → Struggle → Resolution
- Connect to Episode 3 (loops)

E - Examples:
- Reference: Episode 1 structure and style
- Follow: Basketball-Story-Framework-Guide.md
- Match: Character & World Bible tone
- Use: Similar word count and pacing

A - Adaptation:

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
1. **Always start with CLEAR** - Don't skip this step
2. **Be specific** - Vague answers lead to vague results
3. **Provide examples** - Show what you want, don't just describe
4. **Define success** - Know what "done" looks like
5. **Consider constraints** - Mention limitations upfront

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Skip CLEAR** - It saves time in the long run
2. **Be vague** - "Make it better" doesn't help
3. **Forget examples** - AI needs reference points
4. **Ignore constraints** - Mention limitations early
5. **Skip results** - Define success before starting

---

## When to Use CLEAR

### Always Use CLEAR For:
- ✅ New tasks or projects
- ✅ Complex work requiring multiple steps
- ✅ Work that builds on previous work
- ✅ Tasks with unclear requirements
- ✅ Work that needs to match existing style/format

### You Can Skip CLEAR For:
- ❌ Simple, one-step tasks (< 5 minutes)
- ❌ Tasks you've done many times before
- ❌ Quick questions or clarifications
- ❌ Tasks with very clear, simple requirements

## Display in Conversations

### When Talking to AI:
**Start your request with CLEAR formatted like this:**

```
I need help with [TASK]. Using CLEAR framework:

C - Clarity: [Your objectives and requirements]
L - Logic: [Your approach and steps]
E - Examples: [Your references and style guides]
A - Adaptation: [Your constraints and flexibility]
R - Results: [Your success criteria]

[Then add your specific request]
```

### When Documenting:
**Use structured format with headers:**

```markdown
## CLEAR Framework

### C - Clarity
[Detailed objectives]

### L - Logic
[Detailed approach]

### E - Examples
[Detailed references]

### A - Adaptation
[Detailed constraints]

### R - Results
[Detailed success criteria]
```

## Key Takeaway

**CLEAR makes prompts work well because it:**
1. Forces you to think through the task completely
2. Gives AI all the context it needs
3. Establishes clear success criteria
4. Reduces back-and-forth revisions
5. Ensures consistent, high-quality results

**Display CLEAR prominently** at the start of every prompt or task document so it's clear what you're asking for and how success will be measured.

**Remember:** The time spent on CLEAR saves time on revisions and ensures better results.
