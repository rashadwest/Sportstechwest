# BallCODE + IBM: Data Platform Partnership

**Positioning:** We have the data platform and game IBM needs to reach kids. IBM has no data systems in this space.

---

## The Opportunity

**IBM's Challenge:** You need data on how kids learn coding, math, and AI concepts—but you don't have a system that captures this data in an engaging, scalable way.

**Our Solution:** BallCODE is a data-generating platform with an integrated game that kids actually want to use. Every interaction produces valuable learning analytics that IBM can leverage.

**The Leverage:** We have the only sports-to-code platform that generates real learning data. IBM has the reach and resources. Together, we can transform STEM education with data-driven insights.

## What We Bring: The Data Platform

### 1. **Real-Time Learning Analytics**
- **Student Progress Tracking:** Episode completion, skill mastery, learning pathway progression
- **Engagement Metrics:** Time on task, story completion rates, exercise attempt patterns
- **Concept Mastery Data:** Which coding/math/AI concepts students struggle with most
- **Behavioral Analytics:** How students navigate from story → practice → mastery

### 2. **Game-Generated Data**
- **Interactive Exercise Data:** Every block coding attempt, every Python code submission
- **State Tracking Data:** How students understand and apply coding concepts
- **Pattern Recognition Data:** How students identify and solve problems
- **Adaptive Learning Signals:** Where students need more support or challenge

### 3. **Educational Outcomes Data**
- **Learning Objective Completion:** Which objectives students master vs. struggle with
- **Skill Progression Data:** How students move from block coding → Python
- **Assessment Results:** Formative and summative assessment data across all 12 episodes
- **Standards Alignment Data:** CSTA, Common Core, NGSS alignment tracking

### 4. **Platform Infrastructure**
- **Data Collection System:** Built into Unity game, tracks every interaction
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Real-time view of student progress and engagement
- **API-Ready Architecture:** Data can be exported, integrated with IBM systems
- **Scalable Foundation:** Ready to handle thousands of students across multiple schools
