### 4️⃣ Delegate with Context
- [x] **What am I delegating today?** (To AI or humans)
  - **Task 1: Create book layout structure aligned with curriculum and AIMCODE**
    - **Goal:** Design layout that ensures books, curriculum, and game teach concepts consistently
    - **Success Metric:** Layout document created showing how each book connects to curriculum concepts and game exercises, with clear learning progression
    - **Escalation Trigger:** If AI confidence < 80% or unclear requirements → User reviews and provides direction
  - **Task 2: Design integration architecture for books→game→curriculum flow**
    - **Goal:** Create clear system showing how students move between books, game exercises, and curriculum content
    - **Success Metric:** Integration map/document showing user flow, concept connections, and technical implementation approach
    - **Escalation Trigger:** If technical complexity exceeds scope → User reviews and prioritizes
  - **Task 3: UI/UX design recommendations for game integration**
    - **Goal:** Ensure game interface works well for book-to-game transitions and curriculum integration
    - **Success Metric:** UI/UX recommendations document with specific improvements for seamless experience
    - **Escalation Trigger:** If design conflicts with existing game structure → User reviews and decides

### 5️⃣ Use If–Then Rules
- [x] **What automated behaviors am I using today?**
  - [x] If it's 5 AM → then I enter Deep Work
  - [x] If AI confidence < 80% → then I review
  - [x] If task takes < 2 min → then I do it now
  - [x] If task takes > 2 hours → then I break it down
  - [x] **Custom rule:** If I complete book layout → then I move to integration architecture → then UI/UX design

### 6️⃣ Track Your Metrics Daily

  - Answer: **Layout templates** for consistent book structure, **integration patterns** for repeatable connections, **documentation** for tracking progress
- [x] **What am I reserving my time for?** (Creative direction, relationships, judgment)
  - Answer: **Creative decisions** on curriculum alignment, **strategic direction** on integration approach, **quality judgment** on user experience

### 8️⃣ Move One Domino a Day
- [x] **What is the ONE task today that makes everything else easier or unnecessary?**
  - Answer: **Building a clear integration from the books to the game and making sure the curriculum ties in to what they are learning consistently with the books and game**
- [x] **Why is this the domino?** (How does it compound?)
  - Answer: **This creates the foundation for everything else:**
    - ✅ Once books, game, and curriculum are integrated, students learn consistently across all platforms
    - ✅ This unblocks UI/UX improvements (knowing the flow enables better design)
    - ✅ This enables game development (knowing what to build makes development clear)
    - ✅ This creates the learning system that makes BallCODE effective
    - ✅ This is the core value proposition: seamless learning across story, game, and curriculum
- [x] **When will I complete it?**
  - Time: **By end of Deep Work window (5:00 PM)**

## 🎯 TODAY'S ONE DOMINO ANALYSIS

### Your Three Options:

1. **Building a clear integration from the books to the game and making sure the curriculum ties in to what they are learning consistently with the books and game**
2. **Getting the UI/UX to work well for the game**
3. **Getting complete understanding of the game and start on development**

### Recommended ONE Domino: **Option 1** ✅

**Why Option 1 is the Domino:**

**Compounds Most:**
- ✅ **Unblocks Option 2:** Once you know the integration flow, UI/UX design becomes clear (you know what to design for)
- ✅ **Unblocks Option 3:** Once you understand the curriculum integration, game development has clear requirements (you know what to build)
- ✅ **Creates Foundation:** This is the core system that makes everything else work together
- ✅ **Enables Learning:** This is what makes BallCODE effective - consistent learning across platforms

**Why Not Option 2 (UI/UX):**
- ⚠️ **Depends on Option 1:** Can't design good UI/UX without knowing the integration flow
- ⚠️ **Surface Level:** UI/UX is important but secondary to having the right system

**Why Not Option 3 (Game Development):**
- ⚠️ **Depends on Option 1:** Can't develop effectively without understanding curriculum integration
- ⚠️ **Implementation Before Design:** Need to know what to build before building it

**Success Criteria for Option 1:**
- [ ] Book layout document created showing curriculum alignment
- [ ] Integration map showing books→game→curriculum flow
- [ ] Concept consistency matrix (same concepts taught across all three)
- [ ] Learning progression document (how concepts build)
- [ ] Technical integration approach defined

**If You Choose a Different Option:**
- **Option 2:** Focus on UI/UX design for book-to-game transitions
- **Option 3:** Focus on game architecture and development planning

## 📚 BOOK DEVELOPMENT: Layout Aligned with Curriculum & AIMCODE

### Today's Focus: Create Layout Structure

**Objective:** Design book layout that ensures:
1. **Curriculum Consistency:** Same concepts taught in books, game, and curriculum
2. **AIMCODE Alignment:** Follows AIMCODE methodology (Zhang, Resnick, Reggio, Hassabis, Jobs)
3. **Learning Progression:** Concepts build systematically across books
4. **Integration Points:** Clear connections to game exercises and curriculum content

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- How does each book connect to curriculum concepts?
- How do concepts progress from book to book?
- How do books connect to game exercises?
- How does AIMCODE methodology shape the layout?
- What is the learning flow: Book → Game → Curriculum?

**Deliverables:**
1. **Book Layout Document** - Structure showing curriculum alignment
2. **Integration Map** - Visual showing books→game→curriculum flow
3. **Concept Consistency Matrix** - Table showing same concepts across all three
4. **Learning Progression Document** - How concepts build systematically
5. **AIMCODE Integration Guide** - How AIMCODE principles shape the layout

**Next Steps After Layout:**
- Review layout with user
- Refine based on feedback
- Begin implementation in actual books
- Test integration with game
- Validate curriculum alignment
