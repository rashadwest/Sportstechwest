        <p>Rashad West's basketball project is transforming the way youth engage with STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) education. What began as an initiative to teach mathematics through basketball has now evolved into two dynamic platforms: a robot sports coding game for younger kids and an analytics platform designed specifically for NIL athletes. By integrating basketball drills with math concepts like scoring and probability, the program offers students an interactive and practical approach to learning, using the game they love as a tool for academic growth.</p>
        <p>The robot sports coding game allows younger students to program robotic athletes, fostering creativity and problem-solving skills through coding. Meanwhile, the analytics platform empowers NIL athletes to analyze their performance data and monetize it, providing them with tools to leverage their skills both on and off the court. Rashad Westâ€™s vision bridges the gap between athletics and education, ensuring success for both kids and athletes with hands-on experience in robotics, coding, and data analysis</p>
