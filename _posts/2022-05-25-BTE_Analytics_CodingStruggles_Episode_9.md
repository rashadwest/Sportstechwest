# Coding Struggles

I have been working on two things all day today.

1. Developing our coding system for our algorithm.

   - I have developed a couple of ways of extracting the data we need using python
   - Now I am looking to take it straight from the csv file

2. Importing a CSV or excel file into a jupiter notebook.
   - Right now I am using google colab and the challenge I am having is error code after error code.
   - I am going to look into more ways to add the file

- ![Struggle1]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/blog-img/Struggle1.webp?raw=true)
- ![Struggle2]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/blog-img/Struggle2.webp?raw=true)

I need to work on being more productive when I cannot accomplish a goal that I wanted to accomplish on the workday.
