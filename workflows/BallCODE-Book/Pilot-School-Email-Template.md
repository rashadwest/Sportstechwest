Hi [Contact Name],

Great news! We've made excellent progress on Episode 1: The Tip-off Trial, and I'm excited to share what's ready for you to review.

## What's Ready

I'm attaching three documents for you:

1. **Episode 1 Story** - Complete narrative (1,497 words, all 3 acts)
2. **Teacher Guide** - Full lesson plan with answer keys and assessment
3. **Onboarding Guide** - Step-by-step instructions so you can use this independently (no need for me to come into the school!)

## What You Can Do Right Now

**Option 1: Review the Content**
- Read through Episode 1 story
- Review the teacher guide
- Familiarize yourself with the exercises
- Provide feedback on content, age-appropriateness, and alignment with your curriculum

**Option 2: Test the Content**
- Try the exercises yourself
- Share with a small group of students (if ready)
- Test the story reading time and engagement

**Option 3: Plan Implementation**
- Review the teacher guide lesson plan
- Determine how this fits into your schedule
- Identify which students/classes would benefit most

## Current Status

✅ **Ready for Use:**

## What We Need From You

**This Week:**
1. Content review - Read Episode 1 and provide feedback
2. Timeline confirmation - When would you like to start using this?
3. Access preferences - How do you want students to access the content?
   - Print copies?

## Next Steps

1. Review the attached documents
2. Let me know:
   - When you'd like to start
   - How you want to access the content
   - Any questions or concerns

I'm here to support you every step of the way. The onboarding guide is designed so you can get started independently, but I'm always available for questions.
