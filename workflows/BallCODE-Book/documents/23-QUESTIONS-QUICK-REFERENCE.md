**Purpose:** Quick reference for 23-question framework and 4 AI collaboration principles  
**Status:** Quick Reference Guide

---

## 🚀 QUICK START

### For Every Task:

```
1. Principle 3 → Which AIMCODE expert would approach this?
2. 23 Questions → Apply framework (full/quick/skip based on complexity)
3. Principle 1 → What novel approaches could work?
4. Principle 2 → What needs human input?
5. Principle 4 → Is this the best approach?
```

## 📋 THE 4 PRINCIPLES (Quick)

### Principle 1: Always Invite AI to the Table
**Do:** Experiment, explore novel solutions, create new concepts  
**Don't:** Stick to standard approaches only

### Principle 2: Be the Human in the Loop
**Do:** Ask for human input on emotion, strategy, story content, quality  
**Don't:** Generate content that needs human touch without asking

### Principle 3: Treat AI like a Person (Expert Persona)
**Do:** Embody AIMCODE experts (Zhang, Resnick, Reggio, Hassabis, Jobs)  
**Don't:** Use generic AI approach

### Principle 4: Assume Worst AI (Always Improve)
**Do:** Question approaches, research better solutions, optimize  
**Don't:** Settle for "good enough"

## 💡 EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Creating Book Page
```
1. Principle 3: "Zhang would start with story, Jobs would make it simple"
2. 23 Questions: Quick 5 (template-based work)
3. Principle 1: "What if we generate from JSON schema?"
4. Principle 2: "Story content needs user's writing - only suggest structure"
5. Principle 4: "Is template approach best? Could we automate more?"
```

### Example 2: Optimizing Usage
```
1. Principle 3: "Jobs would simplify, Hassabis would optimize systematically"
