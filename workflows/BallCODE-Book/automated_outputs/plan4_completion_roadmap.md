## Critical Path to Completion

### Phase 1: Visual Assets (HIGH PRIORITY - BLOCKING)

**Status:** Automation ready (Plan 2 complete), generation pending

**Tasks:**
1. Generate 3 visual assets using prompts from `plan2_visual_prompts.json`
   - Court Map (priority 1)
   - Shadow Press Scouts (priority 2)
   - State Diagram (priority 3)
2. Integrate visuals into Episode 1 integrated document
3. Verify print-ready quality (300 DPI)
4. Create digital-optimized versions

**Timeline:** 2-4 hours (with API) or 1-2 days (manual)

**Completion Impact:** Unblocks Phase 2, Phase 3, and Production Assets

### Phase 2: Production Assets (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status:** Content ready, waiting for visuals

**Tasks:**
1. Create story PDF (print-ready) - needs visuals
2. Create story PDF (digital-optimized) - needs visuals
3. Generate QR codes (Plan 5 will handle this)
4. Finalize all production materials

**Timeline:** 1-2 days (after visuals complete)

**Dependencies:** Visual assets must be complete

---

### Phase 3: Beta Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Status:** Package ready, needs testers

**Tasks:**
1. Recruit 3-5 beta testers (educators)
2. Send beta testing packages
3. Set feedback deadline (1-2 weeks)
4. Collect and analyze feedback
5. Prioritize revisions

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks (can run in parallel with other work)

**Dependencies:** None (can start now with current content)

---

### Phase 4: Unity Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Status:** Specs complete, needs implementation

**Tasks:**
1. Implement Training Mode exercise for Episode 1
2. Create QR code/short URL
3. Test flow: Story → QR code → Game → Return
4. Verify no-login first play works
5. End-to-end flow testing

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

**Dependencies:** Unity project access required

---

### Phase 5: Final Polish (LOW PRIORITY)

**Status:** Most content complete, needs refinement

**Tasks:**
1. Final polish of story content
2. Polish Skill Pit-Stop language
3. Test exercises with target age group
4. Audio narration script (if applicable)

**Timeline:** 2-3 days

**Dependencies:** Can be done after beta feedback

## Recommended Execution Order

### Week 1: Visual Assets + Production
1. **Days 1-2:** Generate visual assets (use Plan 2 automation)
2. **Day 3:** Integrate visuals into document
3. **Days 4-5:** Create production PDFs

### Week 2: Beta Testing + Unity
1. **Days 1-2:** Launch beta testing (recruit testers)
2. **Days 3-5:** Begin Unity integration (if access available)

### Week 3: Feedback + Polish
1. **Days 1-3:** Collect and analyze beta feedback
2. **Days 4-5:** Implement critical revisions
3. **Final polish:** Complete remaining tasks
