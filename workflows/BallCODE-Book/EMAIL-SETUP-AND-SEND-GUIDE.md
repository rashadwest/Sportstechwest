## ⏰ PART 3: BEST TIME TO SEND EMAIL

### Professional Email Best Practices

**Best Days:**
- ✅ **Tuesday** (highest open rates)
- ✅ **Wednesday** (second best)
- ✅ **Thursday** (third best)
- ❌ **Monday** (too busy)
- ❌ **Friday** (people checking out)
- ❌ **Weekend** (low engagement)

**Best Times:**
- ✅ **9:00 AM - 11:00 AM** (morning, after checking emails)
- ✅ **2:00 PM - 4:00 PM** (afternoon, before end of day)
- ❌ **Early morning** (before 8 AM - emails get buried)
- ❌ **Late afternoon** (after 4 PM - people leaving)
- ❌ **Evening** (after 6 PM - low engagement)

### For FIFA/International Recipient

**Considerations:**
- Tiffany works for FIFA (international organization)
- May be in different time zone
- World Cup prep = very busy schedule
- Professional context = business hours important

**Recommended Send Time:**
- **Day:** Tuesday or Wednesday
- **Time:** 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM (your time zone)
- **Rationale:** 
  - Early enough to catch morning email check
  - Not too early to get buried
  - Professional business hours
  - Mid-week = better engagement

**Alternative (If Different Time Zone):**
- **Send at 2:00 PM your time** (if she's in Europe, this is morning for her)
- **Or send at 8:00 AM your time** (if she's in US East Coast, this is morning for her)

### Time Zone Considerations

**FIFA Headquarters:** Zurich, Switzerland (CET/CEST - UTC+1/+2)

**If Tiffany is in Zurich:**
- **Your 9:00 AM** = Her 3:00 PM (if you're US West Coast)
- **Your 9:00 AM** = Her 2:00 PM (if you're US Central)
- **Your 9:00 AM** = Her 1:00 PM (if you're US East Coast)

**Best Approach:**
- Send at **9:00 AM your local time** on **Tuesday or Wednesday**
- This ensures it arrives during her business hours
- She'll see it in her morning email check (if time zones align) or afternoon (if not)
