- **Message:** "Complete educational content, ready for classroom use."

**3. Curriculum Structure**
- Show 12-episode outline
- Show learning pathway
- Show educational outcomes
- **Message:** "Complete curriculum structure, Episode 1 is proof of concept."

**4. Game Concept (Explain, Don't Demo)**
- Explain game integration vision
- Show game integration spec document
- Explain how it will work
- **Message:** "Game integration is planned and specified. Episode 1 exercise will be built next."

---

## Recommended Demo Flow for IBM

### Slide 5: Episode 1 Preview

**What to Do:**
1. **Show Website (Live):**
   - Open `ballcode.co/episode1` (or local demo)
   - Scroll through story content
   - Show Skill Pit-Stop
   - Show exercises section
   - **Say:** "This is Episode 1, complete and ready. Students can access it online right now."

2. **Show QR Code (Live Scan):**
   - Print QR code
   - Scan with phone during presentation
   - Show it opens Episode 1
   - **Say:** "Students can scan QR codes from the book to access content instantly."

3. **Explain Game Integration (Don't Demo):**
   - **Say:** "The game integration is specified and ready to build. Episode 1 will have a state-tracking exercise in Mathlete mode. Students will watch basketball footage and identify state changes. This is the next development phase."

**Key Message:**
- ✅ Episode 1 content is complete and ready
- ✅ Website is functional and accessible
- ✅ Game integration is planned and specified
- ✅ Ready for partnership and development

## What to Say About Game Development

### If Asked: "Can we see the game?"

**Response Options:**

**Option 1 (Recommended):**
"The game integration is fully specified and ready to build. Episode 1 will have a state-tracking exercise where students watch basketball footage and identify state changes—START, LIVE, DEAD, OUTCOME. The Unity project exists, the integration specs are complete, and we're ready to build it. This would be the next development phase, and we'd love to explore how IBM could support that."

**Option 2 (If They Push):**
"We have the Unity project and complete integration specifications. The Episode 1 exercise needs to be built in Mathlete mode—it's a 1-2 week development task. We can show you the specifications and discuss how we'd build it together."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Game integration is planned and specified
- ✅ Unity project exists
- ✅ Ready to build (not a blocker)
- ✅ Partnership could accelerate development

## Success Criteria

**You're ready for IBM when:**
- [ ] ✅ Episode 1 website deployed and accessible
- [ ] ✅ Presentation deck complete
- [ ] ✅ Visuals generated (or placeholders)
- [ ] ✅ Demo practiced and working
- [ ] ✅ Talking points reviewed
- [ ] ✅ Clear message about game development status

- ❌ Perfect everything (good enough is fine)

---

## Key Insight

**For IBM presentation, you need to show:**
1. ✅ **Content is ready** (Episode 1 complete)
2. ✅ **Website works** (functional and accessible)
3. ✅ **Structure is solid** (12-episode curriculum)
4. ✅ **Vision is clear** (game integration specified)

**You DON'T need:**
- ❌ Working game (can explain vision)
- ❌ Perfect integration (can show specs)
- ❌ Everything built (can show what's ready)

**The goal:** Get a "yes" to partnership discussion, not to show a perfect product.

---

**Status:** ✅ **FEASIBLE** - Website improvements: YES. Game development: NO (but not needed).

**Recommendation:** Focus on what you CAN show (website, content, structure) and explain the game vision. This is enough to get a "yes" from IBM.
