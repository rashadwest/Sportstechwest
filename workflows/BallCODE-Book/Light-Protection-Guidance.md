# Light Protection Guidance for Sharing Without Formal NDA
## Trust-Based Protection Strategies

---

## Overview

When sharing with trusted contacts who may not sign a formal NDA, you can still protect your IP using informal but effective methods. This guidance provides practical steps for sharing materials while maintaining some protection.

## Pre-Sharing Checklist (Informal Protection)

### ✅ Basic Protection Steps

1. **Document What You Share**
   - Keep a log of what you shared, when, and with whom
   - Screenshot or save email exchanges
   - Note any verbal agreements or understandings

2. **Add Informal Confidentiality Notice**
   - Include a simple confidentiality statement in emails/documents
   - Example: "This information is shared in confidence for evaluation purposes"

3. **Use Watermarks (Light)**
   - Add recipient name to documents
   - Include date of sharing
   - Makes it clear the document is tracked

4. **Control Document Format**
   - Share as PDF (harder to edit)
   - Avoid sharing editable formats (Word, Google Docs) unless necessary
   - Consider password protection for sensitive details

5. **Limit Scope**
   - Share only what's necessary for the conversation
   - Start with high-level, add detail as trust builds
   - Don't share everything at once

## Email Confidentiality Statement (Informal)

### Template for Email Sharing

```
Subject: BallCODE Curriculum Overview - Confidential

Hi [Name],

I'm excited to share our BallCODE curriculum overview with you. 
This information is shared in confidence for your evaluation 
and consideration of potential partnership opportunities.

Please note:
- This information is proprietary and confidential
- It's intended for your evaluation purposes only
- Please don't share or distribute without my permission
- I'm happy to discuss any questions you have

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Benefits of Informal Statement
- Establishes expectation of confidentiality
- Creates paper trail of understanding
- Shows you take IP seriously
- Doesn't require legal review
- Still enforceable in some jurisdictions (implied confidentiality)

## Document Protection (Light Touch)

### PDF Security Settings

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Password to Open:** Optional (only if very sensitive)
- **Password to Modify:** Recommended (prevents editing)
- **Printing:** Allow (shows trust, but watermark remains)
- **Copying Text:** Allow (shows trust, but watermark remains)
- **Watermark:** Include recipient name and date

**How to Set in Adobe Acrobat:**
1. File → Properties → Security
2. Set "Security Method" to "Password Security"
3. Check "Require a password to change security settings"
4. Set permissions as desired
5. Add watermark: Tools → Edit PDF → Watermark

### Watermark Template

**Footer Text:**
```
Confidential - Shared with [Name] - [Date]
BallCODE Proprietary Information
```

**Header Text (Optional):**
```
CONFIDENTIAL - FOR EVALUATION ONLY
```

## Sharing Strategy: Progressive Disclosure

### Level 1: One-Pager (No Protection Needed)
- High-level value proposition
- General learning outcomes
- No specific content details
- Safe to share widely

### Level 2: Curriculum Outline (Light Protection)
- Structure and organization
- Episode titles and high-level descriptions
- Learning objectives (general)
- Add email confidentiality statement
- Watermark with recipient name

### Level 3: Sample Content (More Protection)
- One complete episode (Episode 1)
- Full story and exercises
- Password-protected PDF
- Watermarked with recipient name
- Include expiration date in email

### Level 4: Full Curriculum (Partnership Discussion)
- Only after serious interest expressed
- Password-protected
- Heavily watermarked
- Time-limited access
- Consider formal NDA at this stage

---

## Trust-Based Protection Principles

### 1. Start Small, Build Trust
- Share less initially
- Add detail as relationship develops
- Gauge their respect for your IP

### 2. Set Clear Expectations
- Verbal or written understanding
- "This is confidential" - say it explicitly
- "Please don't share" - make it clear

### 3. Track Everything
- Document what you shared
- Keep email records
- Note any verbal agreements

### 4. Watch for Red Flags
- Requesting full curriculum immediately
- Asking for editable formats
- Wanting to "share with team" without permission
- Pushing back on confidentiality

### 5. Trust But Verify
- Check in periodically
- Ask how they're using the information
- Request updates on their evaluation

---

## What to Share at Each Stage

### Initial Conversation (No Documents)
- High-level concept
- Value proposition
- Target audience
- General approach

### After Interest Expressed (One-Pager)
- Executive summary
- Curriculum structure overview
- Learning outcomes (general)
- Partnership opportunities

### After Positive Response (Protected Outline)
- Detailed curriculum structure
- Episode descriptions (high-level)
- Skills progression
- Expansion opportunities
- Light watermark, email confidentiality statement

### After Serious Interest (Sample Episode)
- Complete Episode 1
- Full story and exercises
- Teacher guide sample
- Password-protected PDF
- Watermarked with name
- Time-limited access (60 days)

### Partnership Discussion (Full Curriculum)
- All 12 episodes
- Complete materials
- Technical documentation
- **Consider formal NDA at this stage**
- Partnership agreement with IP clauses

---

## Red Flags (Even with Trusted Contacts)

### Warning Signs:
- Asking for full curriculum before showing serious interest
- Requesting editable formats (Word, etc.)
- Wanting to "share with internal team" without permission
- Pushing back on any confidentiality expectations
- Asking for source code or technical implementations early
- Requesting pricing/financials before partnership discussion

### How to Respond:
- "I'd be happy to share more detailed materials as we progress in our discussions."
- "Let's start with the high-level overview to see if there's alignment."
- "I can provide a sample episode once we understand your specific needs better."
- "I'm happy to discuss partnership terms, but let's first make sure there's a good fit."

---

## Post-Sharing Actions

### If Partnership Proceeds:
- Document what was shared
- Include IP ownership in partnership agreement
- Define licensing terms clearly
- Specify what they can/cannot do

### If Partnership Doesn't Proceed:
- Send friendly follow-up: "Thanks for your interest. As we discussed, the materials I shared are confidential and proprietary. Please confirm you won't use or share them."
- Keep relationship positive
- Document the interaction
- Keep door open for future opportunities

---

## Legal Considerations (Informal)

### What Informal Protection Provides:
- **Evidence of Confidentiality:** Email statements create paper trail
- **Implied Confidentiality:** In some jurisdictions, sharing "in confidence" creates obligation
- **Breach of Confidence:** Can pursue if materials are misused
- **Copyright Protection:** Your materials are automatically copyrighted

### Limitations:
- Less enforceable than formal NDA
- Harder to prove breach
- May not cover all scenarios
- Varies by jurisdiction

### When to Escalate to Formal NDA:
- Large organization (more risk)
- Competitive situation
- Significant financial value
- Multiple people involved
- International sharing
- Long-term partnership discussion

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start Small:** Share less initially, add detail as trust builds
2. **Set Expectations:** Make confidentiality clear (even informally)
3. **Track Everything:** Document what you share and when
4. **Watch for Red Flags:** Trust but verify
5. **Progressive Disclosure:** Share more as interest deepens
6. **Know When to Escalate:** Formal NDA for serious partnerships
7. **Maintain Relationships:** Even if partnership doesn't proceed, keep it positive

---

## Trust vs. Protection Balance

### High Trust, Low Risk:
- One-pager: Minimal protection needed
- Outline: Light watermark, email statement
- Sample: Password, watermark, time limit

### Medium Trust, Medium Risk:
- Add more explicit confidentiality language
- Use password protection
- Set time limits on access
- Request confirmation of understanding

### Lower Trust, Higher Risk:
- Consider formal NDA
- More restrictive sharing
- Staged disclosure over time
- Legal review recommended

---

**Remember:** Even with trusted contacts, it's wise to maintain some protection. The goal is to balance trust with reasonable IP protection. You can always share more later, but you can't un-share what's already been distributed.
