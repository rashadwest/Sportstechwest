# Python Curriculum Structure
## How BallCODE Books Teach Python Through Basketball

**Copyright © 2025 Rashad West. All Rights Reserved.**

**Date:** December 3, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define Python curriculum structure for IBM presentation and school meetings  
**Target:** IBM SkillsBuild integration + STEM school adoption

---

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

**Basketball stories are the FRAMEWORK, not the subject being taught.**

- **Basketball = Framework/Vehicle** - The engaging narrative that makes learning accessible
- **Python + Math + AI = What Students Learn** - Concepts taught through basketball stories
- **Every book must:**
  1. Start with basketball action/situation (not concept explanation)
  2. Show Python/math/coding concepts emerging FROM basketball needs
  3. Follow 3-act structure: Act I (setup/problem), Act II (struggle/learning), Act III (resolution/success)
  4. Make basketball success the proof of concept mastery
  5. Keep story engaging and adventurous (70% story, 30% skill inserts)

## 📚 THREE-PHASE LEARNING PATHWAY

### Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)
**What students do:**
- Learn coding concepts using basketball terminology
- Visual block interface (no typing required)
- Drag blocks together to create programs
- Immediate feedback through integrated game exercises

**Python concepts introduced:**
- Sequences (Book 1)
- Conditionals (Book 2)
- Loops (Book 3)
- Functions (Future books)

**How it works:**
- Students see blocks like "IF defender goes left, THEN crossover right"
- No Python syntax yet - just concepts through blocks
- Basketball terminology makes it accessible

---

### Phase 2: Transition Bridge
**What students do:**
- See how sports language maps to code concepts
- Side-by-side view of blocks and code
- Understand that blocks = code
- See Python syntax alongside blocks

**Python concepts reinforced:**
- Same concepts from Phase 1, now with syntax
- Students see: "This block = this Python code"
- Understanding deepens: "Code is just instructions"

**How it works:**
- Visual comparison: Block on left, Python code on right
- Students see: `if defender_goes_left: crossover_right()`
- Connection made: "Oh, this is the same thing!"

---

### Phase 3: Python Learning
**What students do:**
- Progress to Python syntax
- Same concepts, different representation
- Real-world programming skills
- Write actual Python code

**Python concepts mastered:**
- Sequences: `print("Hello")`
- Conditionals: `if condition: action()`
- Loops: `for i in range(10):`
- Functions: `def function_name():`

**How it works:**
- Students write Python code to solve basketball problems
- Same basketball context, now with real code
- "I can code! This is Python!"

---

## 📖 BOOK-BY-BOOK PYTHON CURRICULUM

### Book 1: The Foundation Block
**Basketball Context:** Breaking the press, sequences of moves  
**Python Concept:** Sequences and basic blocks

**What students learn:**
- **Block Coding:** Drag blocks in sequence
- **Python Foundation:** `print()`, basic commands
- **Concept:** Code executes in order (sequences)

**Python Code Example:**
```python
# Breaking the press - sequences
dribble_forward()
pass_to_teammate()
move_to_position()
```

**Curriculum Alignment:**
- Grade 3-5: Basic sequences
- Grade 6-8: Python syntax introduction
- IBM SkillsBuild: Beginner Python track

---

### Book 2: The Code of Flow
**Basketball Context:** One-on-one, reading defense, crossover dribble  
**Python Concept:** If/then conditionals

**What students learn:**
- **Block Coding:** IF/THEN blocks
- **Python Foundation:** `if condition: action`
- **Concept:** Conditional logic - make decisions

**Python Code Example:**
```python
# Reading defense - conditionals
if defender_goes_left:
    crossover_right()
elif defender_goes_right:
    crossover_left()
else:
    drive_straight()
```

**Curriculum Alignment:**
- Grade 3-5: Decision-making in code
- Grade 6-8: Python conditionals
- IBM SkillsBuild: Conditional logic track

---

### Book 3: The Pattern (In & Out Dribble) - UPDATED
**Basketball Context:** Repeated moves, patterns, deception + **Data-driven strategy**  
**Python Concept:** Loops and repetition + **Data fetching and analysis**

**What students learn:**
- **Block Coding:** REPEAT blocks, loops + **Data fetching blocks**
- **Python Foundation:** `for` loops, `while` loops + **Data analysis**
- **Concept:** Repetition - do something multiple times + **Data helps find patterns**

**Python Code Example:**
```python
# Pattern repetition - loops
for move in range(3):
    fake_left()
    go_right()
    if defender_falls_for_fake:
        break

# NEW: Data fetching and analysis
opponent_data = fetch_opponent_stats()  # Simplified
for game in opponent_data:
    if game.reaction == "left":
        left_count += 1
# Pattern: 87% left reactions
```
