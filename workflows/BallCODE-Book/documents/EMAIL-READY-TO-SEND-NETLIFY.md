Hey [Name],

Following up on the GitHub repository request - I also need Netlify access for the BallCODE website deployment.

What I need:
- Access to the Netlify account/site for ballcode.co
- This will allow me to manage deployments directly
- I can set up automated deployments from GitHub

Why this is needed:
- I've automated the deployment process and need direct Netlify access
- This will enable faster updates and better workflow management
- I'll be able to trigger deployments and monitor build status directly

How to transfer:

Please contact Netlify support at support@netlify.com to transfer the site (ballcode.co) to my account: rashadwest@gmail.com

They will need:
- Current site name: ballcode.co
- Current account holder information
- New account email: rashadwest@gmail.com

Moving Forward:

Once I have Netlify access:
- I'll set up automated deployments from GitHub
- The website will update automatically on every push
- I can monitor and manage all deployments
- Everything will be ready for launch

Timeline:
- I'm ready to take this over immediately
- Once I have access, I can have everything set up within 24 hours
- This will complete the automation setup

Please let me know once you've contacted Netlify support, or if you need any additional information.

Thanks,
Rashad
