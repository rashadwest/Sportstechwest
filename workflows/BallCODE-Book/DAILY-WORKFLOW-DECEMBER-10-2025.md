---

## 🚨 PRE-WORK CHECKLIST (Complete Before Starting Any Work)

### 0️⃣ What Was Completed Recently (December 7-9, 2025) - ASSESSMENT

**✅ COMPLETED TASKS (From December 7, 2025):**
- ✅ Fixed n8n OpenAI node error (404 - changed to chat resource/operation)
- ✅ Created Screenshot-to-Fix automation system design
- ✅ Created n8n workflow JSON for screenshot-to-fix (`n8n-screenshot-to-fix-workflow.json`)
- ✅ Created Python fix processor script (`screenshot_fix_processor.py`)
- ✅ Fixed GitHub Actions workflow (handled missing build_size output)
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for screenshot-to-fix system

**Note:** No workflow files found for December 8-9, 2025. Using December 7, 2025 as most recent reference.

**ONE DOMINO STATUS:** ⏳ IN PROGRESS (n8n workflow fixed but not fully tested/operational)

**WHAT CARRIED OVER TO TODAY:**
1. **Screenshot-to-Fix System Setup** - System designed but may need implementation in n8n
2. **Build Failure Investigation** - May still need to check GitHub Actions build logs
3. **Netlify Setup Verification** - May need to verify deployment pipeline
4. **Header Image** - Header image may still need fixing
5. **Exercise Return Flow** - May not be completed
6. **n8n Workflow Testing** - Fixed OpenAI node but may need full workflow testing
7. **Complete n8n Integration** - Need bulletproof workflow for complete BallCODE integration

**TASKS THAT MAY NOT HAVE FINISHED:**
1. **Screenshot-to-Fix System Implementation** - May not be set up in n8n yet
   - **Why Important:** Eliminates manual error fixing - screenshot → automatic fix → build → deploy
   - **Status:** Design complete, needs implementation verification
2. **Build Failure Investigation** - May not be completed
   - **Why Important:** Blocks deployment and testing
   - **Status:** Workflow file fixed, but builds may still be failing
3. **Netlify Setup Verification** - May not be completed
   - **Why Important:** Ensures deployment pipeline works
4. **Header Image Implementation** - May still not be working
   - **Why Important:** Professional appearance critical for investor meetings
5. **Exercise Return Flow** - May not be completed
   - **Why Important:** Completes the learning loop (Book → Game → Return → Learning)
6. **n8n Workflow Full Test** - OpenAI node fixed but workflow may not be tested end-to-end
   - **Why Important:** Need to verify entire automation pipeline works
7. **Complete n8n Integration** - Need bulletproof workflow
   - **Why Important:** Complete BallCODE integration requires reliable n8n workflow

**BLOCKERS OR ISSUES:**
- **Critical Blockers:** 
  - Need to verify current status of all systems
  - n8n workflow needs to be bulletproof for complete integration
- **Blockers Resolved:** 
  - ✅ n8n OpenAI node 404 error fixed (December 7)
  - ✅ GitHub Actions workflow syntax fixed (December 7)
- **Remaining Blockers:** 
  - Need to assess current state of all systems
  - Complete n8n integration workflow needs to be bulletproof

- [x] **What automation is in place?**
  - Answer: **n8n workflow files exist (n8n-unity-automation-workflow.json, n8n-screenshot-to-fix-workflow.json). OpenAI node fixed (chat endpoint). Screenshot-to-fix system designed. GitHub Actions workflow exists. Netlify deployment pipeline configured. Need to verify all work together and create bulletproof integration.**
- [x] **What accountability exists?**
  - Answer: **Deep work window scheduled. ONE Domino clearly defined. Success criteria: workflow executes reliably, all integration points work, error handling in place, documentation complete. Daily workflow tracking. Progress logged in ROBOT-DECEMBER-10-TASKS.md.**
