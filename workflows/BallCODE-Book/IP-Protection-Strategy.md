# IP Protection Strategy for Curriculum Sharing with IBM

## Overview
This document outlines best practices for sharing BallCODE curriculum materials with IBM (or any potential partner) while protecting intellectual property.

---

## Pre-Sharing Checklist

### ✅ Legal Protection (Do First)
1. **Copyright Registration**
   - Register curriculum content with U.S. Copyright Office
   - Cost: ~$45-65 per work
   - Establishes legal ownership and enables statutory damages

2. **Trademark Protection** (if applicable)
   - Register "BallCODE" trademark if not already done
   - Protects brand identity

3. **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**
   - **REQUIRED before sharing any detailed content**
   - Use mutual NDA (both parties protected)
   - Include specific clauses:
     - Definition of "Confidential Information"
     - Purpose limitation (evaluation only)
     - Non-compete period (2-3 years typical)
     - Return/destruction of materials clause
     - Jurisdiction and dispute resolution

4. **Documentation of Creation**
   - Timestamp all curriculum files
   - Keep version history
   - Document creation dates in metadata

## Sharing Strategy: Tiered Approach

### Tier 1: Executive Summary (No NDA Required)
**What to Share:**
- High-level value proposition
- Learning outcomes (general)
- Target audience
- Educational approach (story-first, game-integrated)
- No specific content details

**Format:** One-page PDF or presentation slide

### Tier 2: Protected Outline (NDA Required)
**What to Share:**
- Curriculum structure (12 episodes)
- Episode titles and one-line descriptions
- Learning objectives per episode (high-level)
- Skills progression map
- **NO detailed story content**
- **NO specific exercises**
- **NO code examples or implementations**

**Format:** Watermarked PDF with "CONFIDENTIAL" headers

### Tier 3: Sample Content (NDA + Limited Access)
**What to Share:**
- ONE complete episode (Episode 1) as proof of concept
- Full story, exercises, teacher guide
- **Only after Tier 2 generates serious interest**
- **Time-limited access (30-60 days)**
- **Tracked document (watermark with recipient name)**

**Format:** Password-protected PDF with expiration date

### Tier 4: Full Curriculum (Partnership Agreement Required)
**What to Share:**
- Complete 12-episode curriculum
- All assets, code, and materials
- **Only after signed partnership/licensing agreement**
- **Include IP ownership clauses in agreement**

---

## Document Protection Techniques

### 1. Watermarking
- **Visible Watermark:**
  - "CONFIDENTIAL - [Recipient Name] - [Date]"
  - Place on every page
  - Use semi-transparent text overlay

- **Invisible Watermark:**
  - Embed recipient-specific metadata
  - Track document distribution
  - Use PDF metadata fields

### 2. PDF Security Settings
- **Password Protection:**
  - Open password (prevents unauthorized viewing)
  - Permissions password (prevents printing/copying)

- **Restrictions:**
  - Disable printing
  - Disable text copying
  - Disable editing
  - Allow viewing only

### 3. Document Tracking
- **Unique Identifiers:**
  - Add recipient-specific codes
  - Track which version went to which contact
  - Include in footer: "Document ID: IBM-2025-001"

- **Digital Fingerprinting:**
  - Use document tracking services (e.g., DocSend, PandaDoc)
  - Monitor when/how document is accessed
  - Get alerts on downloads/prints

### 4. Redaction Strategy
- **Remove from Shared Version:**
  - Specific code implementations
  - Detailed exercise solutions
  - Character backstories and world-building details
  - Game mechanics specifics
  - Revenue/pricing information

- **Replace with Placeholders:**
  - "[Exercise details available upon partnership agreement]"
  - "[Implementation specifics protected]"
  - "[Full story content in partnership package]"

## Recommended Sharing Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Contact (No NDA)
- Share: Executive Summary (Tier 1)
- Purpose: Generate interest
- Format: Email attachment or presentation

### Step 2: Interest Expressed (NDA Required)
- Request: Mutual NDA signed
- Share: Protected Outline (Tier 2)
- Purpose: Show structure and value
- Format: Watermarked PDF with tracking

### Step 3: Serious Interest (NDA + Limited Sample)
- Share: Episode 1 Sample (Tier 3)
- Purpose: Proof of concept
- Format: Password-protected, time-limited PDF
- Access: 30-60 days, tracked

### Step 4: Partnership Discussion (Legal Agreement)
- Share: Full curriculum (Tier 4)
- Purpose: Partnership/licensing negotiation
- Format: Secure data room or controlled access
- Agreement: Must include IP ownership clauses

## NDA Template Key Clauses

### Essential Clauses for Curriculum Sharing:

1. **Definition of Confidential Information**
   ```
   "Confidential Information" includes but is not limited to:
   - Curriculum content, lesson plans, and educational materials
   - Story narratives, character designs, and world-building elements
   - Exercise designs, assessment tools, and answer keys
   - Technical implementations, code, and game mechanics
   - Business plans, financial projections, and pricing models
   ```

2. **Purpose Limitation**
   ```
   Recipient may use Confidential Information solely for the purpose of
   evaluating a potential partnership or licensing arrangement. No other
   use is permitted without express written consent.
   ```

3. **Non-Compete Period**
   ```
   Recipient agrees not to develop, market, or distribute any competing
   educational product based on concepts, structures, or methodologies
   disclosed in Confidential Information for a period of [3] years from
   the date of disclosure.
   ```

4. **Return/Destruction**
   ```
   Upon request or termination of discussions, Recipient shall return
   or destroy all Confidential Information and certify in writing that
   all copies have been destroyed.
   ```

5. **IP Ownership**
   ```
   All Confidential Information remains the property of Discloser.
   No license or ownership rights are granted by this Agreement.
   ```

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Warning Signs During Discussions:
- Requesting full curriculum before NDA
- Asking for source code or technical implementations early
- Pushing for "just a quick look" without formal process
- Requesting materials to "share with internal team" without NDA
- Asking for pricing/financials before showing serious interest
- Requesting materials in editable formats (Word, etc.)

### How to Respond:
- "I'd be happy to share more detailed materials after we have an NDA in place."
- "Let's start with the high-level outline to see if there's alignment."
- "I can provide a sample episode once we have a signed NDA and understand your specific needs."

---

## Alternative: Presentation Format

Instead of sharing documents, consider:

### Live Presentation Approach
- **Advantages:**
  - Control what's shown
  - No documents to track
  - Interactive Q&A
  - Can gauge interest in real-time

- **Format:**
  - Screen share presentation
  - Show structure, not details
  - Answer questions without revealing specifics
  - Follow up with protected outline if interest confirmed

### Video Walkthrough
- **Advantages:**
  - Controlled content
  - Can be password-protected
  - Shows product without sharing files
  - Can be time-limited access

---

## Post-Sharing Actions

### If Partnership Proceeds:
- Include IP ownership in partnership agreement
- Define licensing terms clearly
- Specify what IBM can/cannot do with materials
- Include termination and IP return clauses

### If Partnership Doesn't Proceed:
- Request written confirmation of material return/destruction
- Document what was shared (for future reference)
- Maintain relationship for potential future opportunities
- Keep NDA active for specified period

---

## Recommended Tools

### Document Protection:
- **Adobe Acrobat Pro:** Advanced PDF security and watermarking
- **DocSend:** Document tracking and analytics
- **PandaDoc:** Secure document sharing with tracking
- **Microsoft Information Protection:** Enterprise-grade document protection

### Legal:
- **LegalZoom:** NDA templates and legal document review
- **Rocket Lawyer:** Customizable NDA templates
- **Attorney Review:** Recommended for partnership agreements

### Tracking:
- **Google Analytics:** Track document downloads (if hosted)
- **Email Tracking:** Monitor email opens (if sent via email)
- **Watermarking Services:** Professional document watermarking

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always use an NDA** before sharing detailed materials
2. **Start high-level**, share details only as interest deepens
3. **Watermark and track** all shared documents
4. **Control access** with passwords and time limits
5. **Document everything** you share and when
6. **Get legal review** for partnership agreements
7. **Trust your instincts** - if something feels off, slow down

**Remember:** It's better to share too little initially and provide more later, than to share everything upfront and lose control of your IP.
