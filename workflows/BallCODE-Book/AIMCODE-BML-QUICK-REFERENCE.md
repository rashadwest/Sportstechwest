## The BML Cycle

```
BUILD (AIMCODE) → MEASURE (Metrics) → LEARN (Analysis) → Repeat
```

---

## Weekly Cycle

### Monday-Wednesday: BUILD
- Apply AIMCODE methodology
- Create story/game feature
- Document hypothesis
- Set up metrics

### Thursday: MEASURE
- Collect metrics data
- Identify patterns
- Initial analysis
- Prepare for LEARN

### Friday: LEARN
- Deep analysis
- Synthesize insights
- Refine AIMCODE
- Plan next cycle

---

## BUILD Phase: AIMCODE Workflow

**CLEAR Framework:**
- C - Clarity: Clear objectives?
- L - Logic: Logical approach?
- E - Examples: Relevant examples?
- A - Adaptation: Flexibility needed?
- R - Results: Success criteria?

**Alpha Evolve:**
- Layer 1: Foundation
- Layer 2: Build on layer 1
- Layer 3: Build on layer 2
- Layer 4: Integration

**Research:**
- Tier 1: Quick (5 min)
- Tier 2: Standard (15 min)
- Tier 3: Deep (30+ min)

**Experts:**
- Zhang: Story-first
- Resnick: Building
- Reggio: Multiple entry points
- Hassabis: Systematic
- Jobs: Simplicity

## MEASURE Phase: Key Metrics

**Story Engagement:**
- Page views, time, completion rate
- Target: >70% completion

**Story→Game Integration:**
- Transition clicks, success rate, return rate
- Target: >60% click, >80% return

**Game Performance:**
- Exercise completion, success rate, attempts
- Target: >75% completion, >70% success

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Concept mastery, progression
- Target: >75% mastery

---

## LEARN Phase: Analysis

**What Worked?**
- Successes to repeat

**What Didn't?**
- Failures to avoid

**Why?**
- Root cause analysis

**How to Improve?**
- Refinements for next cycle

---

## Integration Points

**Story Creation:**
