### Coding Zaila Combos

- Here is the last 5 moves of the database at the end of the blog.
- The moves are as follows: `454, 145, 441, 441, 241`
- How did I code these moves to get the BTE score? I will go through it now.

We teach the coding language Python through simply watching basketball moves and translating the moves into code. Here is Zalia Avant-Garde (spelling bee champion and ball player) putting on a show with her dribble combos and shots.

### List for Calculation

- This is what we start with when we are doing a group of attacking moves and shots
  ![First List]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/blog-img/Coding_Moves_AA.webp?raw=true)

### Calculating BTE Score

- Next I put in the formula for these move seuqences and values of the shot locations
- I used this formula `BTE_Combo X BTE_Value = BTE Score`

### Create list for database

- These are the Pre-defined lists I made to create the database

### Create database

- This is where I imported the pandas library
- I think created a dictonary wich is the database you will see at the end
- The panda dataframe action will house the data
- Then I `print(Zaila)`

### Full Code

- This is the full code
- At the end you see Zalias database we created as the result
