As [NBA Draft](https://www.nba.com/draft) night approaches on **June 25–26**, teams are meticulously evaluating prospects, looking for that elusive edge. The **1v1 matchup** – the very essence of many [NBA possessions](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) – is a critical test of a player's true ability. Yet, high-level, competitive 1v1 data for men's basketball has historically been scarce, often limited to post-career exhibitions, isolated pro-am runs, or informal scrimmages, rather than structured, high-stakes competition.

This is precisely where the [**Unrivaled League**](https://wnba.com) offers an unprecedented window. For the first time, we're seeing elite professional women compete in highly competitive 1v1 tournaments, generating invaluable, **quantifiable data** in a format never before consistently available at this level. This unique dataset provides a powerful new lens through which to explore what truly gives a player the decisive advantage in one-on-one situations.

At **BTE Analytics**, we studied a compelling matchup from the Unrivaled League between [**Aaliyah Edwards**](https://www.wnba.com/player/aaliyah-edwards) and [**Napheesa Collier**](https://www.wnba.com/player/napheesa-collier), two elite athletes who possess physicality, size, and mobility. What the data revealed is something every NBA coach, GM, and performance director should pay close attention to as they finalize their draft boards.

## Before We Get to the Outcome, Let's Define Our Terms

- **Mobility** is how well a player moves: their speed, lateral quickness, and ability to cover ground.
- **Versatility** is how many different ways a player can score, counter, or adapt once they're in the play.

When we broke down the data, the difference between mobility and versatility was clear — and **decisive**.

## What We Saw

> **Mobility gets you there. Versatility decides what happens next.**

Edwards had the edge in speed and straight-line power. But Collier matched her size and used a wider skill set. She didn't need to be faster; she just needed more answers.

**Collier's versatility controlled the tempo.** She used six distinct shot types and countered **78.3%** of the time. She leaned into spin moves to create space and shift angles. That offensive variety made her unpredictable and difficult to scout.

**Predictability limits outcomes.** Edwards went right **84.6%** of the time. Collier, however, forced defenders to play both sides with a more balanced hand profile. That hesitation opened up lanes and created scoring windows Edwards couldn't access.

## Bottom Line

At the elite level, **every NBA prospect can move**. What separates the great from the dominant – the future stars from the role players – is the ability to **adapt, counter, and solve problems in real time**.

> **Athleticism opens the door. Versatility walks you through it.**

Mobility got Edwards into position. Versatility let Collier take over. The insights gleaned from **Unrivaled's high-stakes 1v1 format** provide a clear blueprint. While this specific matchup was in the **WNBA's Unrivaled League**, the principles are **universally applicable** to elite basketball and offer critical lessons for NBA scouting departments.

The Unrivaled League is providing exactly the kind of structured 1v1 data the NBA has lacked.

And that's not just a player insight. That's a development insight. That's a scouting insight. That's a business insight.

## As Scouting Departments Finalize Their Draft Boards for June 25–26

- Are you developing players who can **react** or players who can **adjust** to the ever-changing NBA game?
- Are you building systems that reward **athleticism** or reward **solutions for complex defensive schemes**?
- Are your scouting models identifying talent that wins in **chaos** on an NBA court or only in **structure**?

Because in elite competition, the game isn't about **who moves best**.  
It's about **who solves best**.

In sports and in business, **the edge goes to the one with more options.**
