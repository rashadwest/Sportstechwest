# BallCODE School Outreach Kit (School-First)

**Purpose:** One place for school-facing language + pilot outline + implementation steps + parent email templates.

## 1-Page Offer (copy-ready)

### What BallCODE is
BallCODE is a story-driven literacy + STEM program that teaches real coding and math through basketball.

Students:
- read an engaging basketball story
- learn a clear concept
- prove it with short interactive challenges (60–90 seconds)

### Why schools adopt
- **Engagement:** basketball narrative keeps attention while teaching real skills
- **Clarity:** a consistent learning path (Blocks → Bridge → Python)
- **Implementation:** teacher-ready flow (minimal prep)
- **Proof:** progress that can be summarized for teachers and principals (Telemetry)

### Who it’s for
Grades **3–8** (recommended bands: **3–5** and **6–8** so teachers can differentiate difficulty while keeping the same story spine).

### What’s included
- Episode/Book module(s): story + mini-lesson + challenges
- Teacher guide + answer keys
- Student access instructions
- Parent email templates (school sends)

### Call to action
- **Request a Pilot** (recommended primary CTA)
- **Schedule a 15-minute discovery call**

### Purchasing (simple)
See: `documents/OFFER-LADDER-SCHOOL-FIRST.md`
- Pilot → Classroom Annual → School/Site Annual → District

## Pilot Outline (2–4 weeks)

### Goal
Prove engagement + ease-of-implementation and produce a simple “School Readiness” summary for leadership.

### Week-by-week
- **Week 0 (setup):** teacher quick-start (30–60 min), access links/codes, confirm schedule
- **Week 1:** run Episode/Book 1 module (single class or 2-day version)
- **Week 2:** repeat with another group OR run extensions and collect feedback
- **Week 3–4 (optional):** deepen practice, collect outcomes, finalize summary

### What BallCODE needs from the school
- a point-of-contact (teacher/coach/administrator)
- a target class/group
- light feedback (what worked, what didn’t, what to improve)

## Implementation Steps (teacher-ready)

### Fast start (15–20 minutes)
Use the existing onboarding guide:
- `Pilot-School-Onboarding-Guide.md`

### Recommended classroom flow (45–60 minutes)
1. Hook (5 min): basketball → coding connection
2. Story (15–20 min)
3. Mini-lesson (5–10 min): the concept
4. Challenges (15–20 min)
5. Reflection (5–10 min): what they learned and where they saw it

### Device constraints
- Works without devices (story + paper exercises)
- Game challenges can be added when devices are available
