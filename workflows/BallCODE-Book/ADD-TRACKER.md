## 🎯 FOCUS IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES

### If-Then Rules for Focus

1. **If** I want to switch tasks before ONE thing is complete → **Then** I log it as a deviation and ask: "Is this truly urgent or can it wait?"

2. **If** I feel distracted → **Then** I review the ONE thing success criteria and refocus

3. **If** I complete the ONE thing → **Then** I celebrate and can move to next priority

4. **If** I have multiple urgent tasks → **Then** I pick ONE and defer others until it's complete

## 📝 HOW TO USE THIS TRACKER

### At Start of Each Chat Session:
1. AI checks `DATE-TIME-TRACKER.md` for current date
2. AI checks `OVERALL-GOAL-TRACKING.md` for today's ONE thing
3. AI displays the ONE thing prominently at chat start
4. User confirms or updates the ONE thing
5. AI tracks all actions against the ONE thing

### During Session:
1. Before switching tasks, AI asks: "Is the ONE thing complete?"
2. If NO and user wants to switch → Log as deviation
3. If YES → Mark complete and allow new task

### At End of Session:
1. Update completion status
2. Log any deviations
3. Note patterns if identified
4. Update weekly metrics
