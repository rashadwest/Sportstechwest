> CES is great theater, but the real tells show up before you ever badge in. After a decade on the floor and a year in arenas, here are the bets I’m willing to be wrong about. If sports tech is going to matter in 2026, it’ll look less like “AI for everything” and more like a handful of simple, addictive loops that coaches, athletes, and fans can’t stop using—because they save time, win games, or make money.

## 1) AI‑native coaching assistants

- Player‑specific daily plans that respect workload caps
- Auto‑generated video cuts; coach edits stick and compound
- Attribution: minutes saved, injuries avoided, set‑play execution lift
- What demos well at CES: flashy clip finders
- What ships by Q4: planner + cut assistant with constraints

## 2) Camera‑as‑sensor for everyone

- College/youth get league‑grade CV as a service; calibration‑free multi‑cam
- Privacy‑first pose; verified highlights and auto‑statting tournaments
- ROI: recruiting film, verified moments, sponsorable clips
- CES demo: 1‑cam magic
- Q4 ship: bundle with scheduling + stat export

## 3) Stadium OS and digital twins

- Live “what‑if” for queues, staffing, concessions; ops‑driven dynamic pricing
- Heat‑maps that drive decisions, not slides
- Metrics: per‑cap lift, complaints down, SLAs hit
- CES demo: glossy twin
- Q4 ship: ops panels with 3 must‑have levers

## 4) Betting 2.0 with integrity tech

- Micro‑markets plus watermarking/compliance rails
- Better session analytics; fewer novelty props, more durable plays
- CES demo: widget zoo
- Q4 ship: verified feed + compliance SDK

## 5) Athlete‑creator studios

- Team/league mini‑networks replace RSN habits
- Creator pipelines: shoot → edit → clear → publish in one lane
- Metrics: time‑to‑publish, hours watched, merch attach

## 6) Women’s sports infra moment

- Rights packaging tuned for growth curves, not replica models
- Measurement that reflects reality (not copy‑paste)
- Commerce pipes that align with fan journeys

## 7) Health data portability

- Consent lanes and verifiable logs (who saw what, when)
- New licensing models for research and performance
- “Bring your data to practice” becomes normal

## 8) Fan identity without the jargon

- Loyalty that persists across platforms
- Earned status tied to actions that matter (attendance, creation, coaching)

## 9) Broadcast UX gets playful

- Shoppable stats, alt‑casts, near‑zero latency for “coach‑along” modes
- Personalization that doesn’t break production

## What I’ll actually look for before CES

- Demos that shorten a painful workflow by 50%+
- Clear constraints and metrics (not vibes)
- Shipping paths with 1–2 core levers, not 10 features
