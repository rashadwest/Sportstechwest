# BTE_Analytics_Visualizations

![BTE Analytics Visualizations]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/blog-img/Scatter%20Plot%20for%20data%20.webp?raw=true)

Here are some of the visualizations we have created for looking at dribble data between Kyrie, Steph, and CJ McCollum. I need to add different parts

adding it.
