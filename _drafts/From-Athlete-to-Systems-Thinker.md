> Athletes are trained systems thinkers long before they ever touch technology. The habits—pattern recognition, feedback, iteration, adaptation—transfer directly to building in tech.

## Hook

I didn’t learn systems thinking in a lab. I learned it under a shot clock—reading space, testing options, adjusting to constraints. Later, in NBA analytics and engineering, the same habits showed up with different jerseys.

## Core idea

Athletic instincts map cleanly to technical instincts. If we make the mapping explicit, former athletes become elite builders.

## The four habits that transfer

1) Pattern recognition  
   - Film study → feature spotting  
   - Scouting reports → data priors

2) Feedback  
   - Next‑play corrections → tight learning loops  
   - Coach review → code review

3) Iteration  
   - Drill progressions → incremental design  
   - Reps → deliberate practice on bottlenecks

4) Adaptation  
   - Game plans vs reality → resilience under changing constraints  
   - Reads → branching logic and guardrails

## A repeatable personal framework

- Observe: What changed? What stayed invariant?  
- Model: What matters most? What can be ignored?  
- Test: What single change improves outcomes fastest?  
- Ship: What’s the smallest version that proves it?

## How I use this now

- In classrooms, to help students move from story → model → code  
- With teams, to turn “innovation” into workflows that win time or money  
- In writing, to translate sport instincts into technical systems
