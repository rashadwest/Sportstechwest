## ✅ QUICK TEST: Try Entitlement License

**I found an entitlement license file on your Mac!**

**Let's try using it - it might work!**

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP (2 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Copy License File**

**I'll copy it for you:**

```bash
# The file is at:
~/Library/Unity/licenses/UnityEntitlementLicense.xml
```

**OR I can open it for you to copy manually.**

### **Step 2: Add to GitHub Secrets**

1. **I opened GitHub Secrets page for you**
2. **Click:** "New repository secret"
3. **Name:** `UNITY_LICENSE`
4. **Secret:** Paste the entire contents of `UnityEntitlementLicense.xml`
5. **Click:** "Add secret"

### **Step 3: Test Build**

**After adding:**
- Trigger a new build
- See if it works!

**If it works:** ✅ You're done! No waiting!

**If it doesn't work:** Try Method 1 (upload activation file)

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS MIGHT WORK

**Unity's new license format:**
- Uses entitlement licenses (XML format)
- Some CI/CD systems support it
- Worth trying before uploading activation file

**If it doesn't work:**
- No harm done
- Just try Method 1 next

## ✅ ALTERNATIVE: Upload Activation File

**If entitlement license doesn't work:**

1. **Go to:** https://license.unity3d.com/
2. **Upload:** `Unity_v2021.3.10f1.alf`
3. **Get:** License file or serial
4. **Add:** To GitHub Secrets
5. **Done!**

**This takes 5 minutes and always works!**
