**[B-ROLL: STW News opener — 2–3 s]**

An Olympic champion’s app just became core infrastructure for pro women’s sports.

**[B-ROLL: Jessica Ennis-Hill — track/heptathlon or podium still]**

This week, Orreco — the AI performance company backed by Mark Cuban, used by national teams and the WNBA — acquired Jennis. That’s the women’s health and performance app co-founded by heptathlon gold medalist Jessica Ennis-Hill.

**[B-ROLL: Jennis app — app store or official promo image]**

Jennis was built around hormone-intelligent content: education and training for women athletes, partly from Ennis-Hill’s own experience returning to competition after pregnancy.

**[B-ROLL: Orreco / FitrWoman — dashboard or team graphic if available; else Orreco logo]**

Orreco already runs FitrWoman — used by the US and England women’s soccer teams, USA Swimming, WNBA, and NWSL. Now Jennis’s content gets woven into Orreco’s dashboards: same ecosystem, one place for data and guidance.

**[B-ROLL: Split or composite: “women’s performance” — team imagery or abstract data viz]**

So we’re not just watching a startup get bought. We’re watching one athlete’s answer to “how do I come back?” become the backbone of how the best women’s teams in the world prepare and recover.

**[B-ROLL: STW News or Sportstechwest end card — 1–2 s]**

That’s STW News. More next time.
