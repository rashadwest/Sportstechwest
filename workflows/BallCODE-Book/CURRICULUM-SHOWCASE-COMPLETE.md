## 📚 PART 1: CURRICULUM STRUCTURE

### The Three-Phase Learning Pathway

#### Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)
**AIMCODE Alignment:** Resnick (Constructionist) + Reggio (Multiple Entry Points)

**What Students Experience:**
- Learn coding concepts using basketball terminology
- Visual block interface (no typing required)
- Drag blocks together to create programs
- Immediate feedback through integrated game exercises

**Example - Book 1: Sequences**
```
Block Interface:
┌─────────────────┐
│ START           │
├─────────────────┤
│ MOVE FORWARD    │
├─────────────────┤
│ PASS BALL       │
├─────────────────┤
│ MOVE TO POSITION│
└─────────────────┘
```

**Basketball Context:**
- "Breaking the press" = sequence of moves
- "First move forward, then pass, then reposition"
- Students understand: "Code is just instructions!"

**Learning Objectives:**
- ✅ Understand coding concepts through familiar basketball language
- ✅ Create programs using visual blocks
- ✅ See that code is just instructions
- ✅ Gain confidence before moving to text-based coding

**Assessment:**
- Block coding exercises in game

- Concept understanding questions

---

#### Phase 2: Transition Bridge
**AIMCODE Alignment:** Hassabis (Systematic) + Jobs (Simple Design)

**What Students Experience:**
- See how sports language maps to code concepts
- Side-by-side view of blocks and code
- Understand that blocks = code
- See Python syntax alongside blocks

**Example - Book 1: Sequences**
```
Block View:              Code View:
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐
│ MOVE FORWARD│    =    │ move_forward()      │
└─────────────┘         └─────────────────────┘

┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐
│ PASS BALL   │    =    │ pass_to_teammate()  │
└─────────────┘         └─────────────────────┘
```

**Connection Made:**
- "Oh, this block is the same as this code!"

✅ **Evidence:** Block coding, game exercises, Python projects  
✅ **Result:** Hands-on, building-focused learning

### Reggio (Multiple Entry Points)
✅ **Aligned:** Multiple ways to express understanding  
✅ **Evidence:** Story, game, code, visual pathways  
✅ **Result:** Accessible to all learning styles

### Hassabis (Systematic Deep Learning)
✅ **Aligned:** Layer-by-layer progression  
✅ **Evidence:** Sequences → Conditionals → Loops  
✅ **Result:** Deep, systematic understanding

### Jobs (Design Simplicity)
✅ **Aligned:** Simple, beautiful, "it just works"  
✅ **Evidence:** Intuitive pathway, clear progression  
✅ **Result:** Frictionless learning experience
