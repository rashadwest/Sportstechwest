## What's Missing for IBM Teaser (Critical Gaps)

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Visual Assets (30% Complete - BLOCKER)

**Problem:** You have visual briefs but NO actual images. For a teaser presentation, visuals are essential.

**What's Needed:**
1. **Court Map Visual** - Shows the basketball court with tech elements
2. **Shadow Press Scouts Visual** - The "villain" characters
3. **State Diagram Visual** - The coding concept visualization

**Impact:** Without visuals, the presentation feels incomplete. Visuals make the concept tangible.

**Solution Options:**
- **Option A (Fastest - 2-4 hours):** Use AI image generation with prompts from `automated_outputs/plan2_visual_prompts.json`
- **Option B (Professional - 1-2 days):** Commission quick illustrations
- **Option C (Quick Demo):** Use placeholder/mockup visuals for teaser, real ones later

**Recommendation:** Generate 3 images using AI (Glif, DALL-E, or Midjourney) with the prompts you already have. This is fast and gets you presentation-ready visuals.

### 🟡 IMPORTANT: Presentation Deck

**Problem:** You have documents but no slide deck for presentation.

**What's Needed:**
- 5-10 slide deck covering:
  1. The Problem (low STEM engagement)
  2. The Solution (BallCODE approach)
  3. How It Works (3-phase pathway)
  4. Episode 1 Demo (with visuals)
  5. Curriculum Overview (12 episodes)
  6. Partnership Opportunity
  7. Next Steps

**Solution:** Create a simple PowerPoint/Keynote deck using content from IBM-One-Pager.

---

### 🟡 IMPORTANT: Demo-Ready Episode 1

**Problem:** Episode 1 is 45% complete - missing visuals for full impact.

**What's Needed:**
- Episode 1 with visuals integrated (even if placeholders)
- Or: Clean PDF version that looks polished
- Or: Website demo ready (you have this!)

**Solution:** 
- Use website page (`automated_outputs/episode1_page.html`) - this is ready!
- Or create a simple PDF with story + placeholders for visuals

1. Use content from `IBM-One-Pager-Executive-Summary.md`
2. Create 7-10 slides:
   - Slide 1: Title + BallCODE tagline
   - Slide 2: The Problem (low STEM engagement)
   - Slide 3: The Solution (sports-to-code pathway)
   - Slide 4: How It Works (3-phase learning)
   - Slide 5: Episode 1 Preview (with visuals)
   - Slide 6: 12-Episode Curriculum Overview
   - Slide 7: Educational Outcomes
   - Slide 8: Partnership Opportunity
   - Slide 9: Next Steps
3. Add visuals once generated

**Result:** Professional presentation deck

### Solution 3: Demo Website (Already Ready!)

**Steps:**
1. Deploy `automated_outputs/episode1_page.html` to ballcode.co (or use local demo)
2. Show live website during presentation
3. Demonstrate QR codes (scan them live)
4. Show story, Skill Pit-Stop, exercises

**Result:** Interactive demo that shows working product

## Recommended Approach for Saturday

### Option A: Full Package (Best Impact - 4-6 hours work)

1. **Generate 3 visuals** (2-4 hours)
   - Use AI generation with existing prompts

   - Test QR codes
   - Prepare talking points

**Result:** Professional teaser with visuals, deck, and demo

---

### Option B: Minimal Viable Teaser (2-3 hours work)

1. **Create presentation deck** (1-2 hours)
   - Use content from IBM One-Pager
   - Use placeholder text for visuals ("Visual coming soon")
   
2. **Prepare website demo** (30 minutes)
   - Deploy or prepare local demo
   - Test functionality
   
3. **Print QR codes** (15 minutes)
