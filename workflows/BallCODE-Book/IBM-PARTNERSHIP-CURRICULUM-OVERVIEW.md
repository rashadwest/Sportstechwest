## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

BallCODE is an innovative educational program that teaches Python programming, mathematics, and AI concepts through engaging basketball narratives and interactive gameplay. The curriculum combines story-based learning (Duolingo-style) with visual block coding (Scratch-style) to create an accessible pathway from sports language to Python programming.

**Target Audience:** Elementary & Middle school students (grades 3-8), expanding to high school  
**Format:** 12-page storybooks with integrated game exercises  
**Approach:** 70% story, 30% skill instruction with hands-on practice  
**Unique Value:** First-of-its-kind sports-to-code learning pathway  
**Status:** Foundation series (Books 1-3) in development, full curriculum framework complete

## CURRICULUM STRUCTURE

### Learning Pathway Overview

The BallCODE curriculum follows a progressive three-phase learning pathway:

1. **Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)**
   - Students learn coding concepts using basketball terminology
   - Visual block interface (no typing required)
   - Immediate feedback through game integration

2. **Phase 2: Transition Bridge**
   - Students see how sports language maps to code concepts
   - Side-by-side view of blocks and code
   - Understanding that blocks = code

3. **Phase 3: Python Learning Option**
   - Students can progress to Python syntax
   - Same concepts, different representation
   - Real-world programming skills

## RESEARCH-BACKED METHODOLOGY

### AIMCODE Framework
BallCODE curriculum is built on five research-backed principles:

1. **Zhang (AI + Math Storytelling):** Concepts emerge from narrative, not explanation
2. **Resnick (Constructionist Pedagogy):** Students build to learn, not consume
3. **Reggio Emilia (Multiple Entry Points):** Multiple ways to express understanding
4. **Hassabis (Systematic Deep Learning):** Layer-by-layer progression
5. **Jobs (Design Simplicity):** Simple, beautiful, "it just works"

**Evidence:**
- Story-first approach increases engagement
- Building-focused learning improves retention
- Multiple pathways increase accessibility
- Systematic progression ensures mastery
- Simple design reduces friction
