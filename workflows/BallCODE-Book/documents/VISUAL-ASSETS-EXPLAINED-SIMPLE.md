## 🎯 What Are Visual Assets?

**Visual assets = 3 images** that make your Book 1 story more engaging and professional.

Think of them like **illustrations in a children's book** - they help students **see** what they're reading about.

---

## 📸 The 3 Images You Need

### **1. Court Map** 🏀
**What it is:** A picture of a basketball court showing the center circle

**Why you need it:**
- Students read about "the center circle" in the story
- Without a picture, they can't visualize WHERE the action happens
- Makes the story more engaging

**What it looks like:** Basketball court diagram with tech/code elements around the circle

---

### **2. Shadow Press Scouts** 👥
**What it is:** A picture of the "bad guys" in your story (the opposing team)

**Why you need it:**
- Students read about "Shadow Press Scouts" causing trouble
- Without a picture, they can't visualize WHO the enemy is
- Makes the story more exciting (like seeing the villain in a movie)

**What it looks like:** Basketball player in defensive stance, dark/blue colors

---

### **3. State Diagram** 📊
**What it is:** A flowchart showing the coding concept (possession states)

**Why you need it:**
- Students learn about "states" (Our Ball, Their Ball, Neutral)
- Without a picture, the concept is abstract and hard to understand
- Makes the coding concept visual and clear

**What it looks like:** Flowchart with boxes and arrows showing state transitions
