#BTE Analytics Episode 2

[BTE Video](https://youtu.be/tCtPDMCJP6M)

This is our Director of Basketball Operations Adrian doing one of his drills to show his athletes. We created a game to show how to create the list of moves Adrian is doing using python. I look forward to hearing everyones feedback.

Zaila was working on her moves and I took each move and showed it by creating a box score of her moves. I am looking to do this for professional players this week manually to figure out the best way to show how effective players are with certain moves.
