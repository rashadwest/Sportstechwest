## BallCODE Launches at CES 2026: First Sports-Based Coding Education Platform

**Teaching Coding Through Basketball Stories - 10 Pilot Schools Already Running**

---

**RALEIGH, NC - January 7, 2026** - BallCODE, the first sports-based coding education platform, launches today at CES 2026. The platform teaches coding, math, and AI concepts through basketball stories, making complex STEM concepts accessible to students in grades 3-8.

**The Problem:**
Most coding education is abstract. Students learn "if-then" statements without context. They memorize syntax without understanding logic.

**The Solution:**
BallCODE teaches coding through basketball. When students call a play, they're learning sequences. When they analyze a shot, they're learning probability. When they read a defense, they're learning pattern recognition.

**The Remarkable Result:**
Students don't realize they're learning coding. They think they're playing basketball.

## What Makes BallCODE Different

**Story-Driven Learning:**
Each lesson is a basketball story. Students learn coding concepts by solving basketball problems. They learn math by analyzing game situations. They learn AI by reading defensive patterns.

**Three-Phase Learning Pathway:**
1. **Sports Language (Block Coding)** - Visual blocks using basketball terminology
2. **Transition Bridge** - See blocks transform into Python code
3. **Python Learning** - Write actual Python code with same concepts

**Already Proven:**
10 pilot schools are already running BallCODE programs. Teachers report it's the most engaging STEM program they've seen. Students actually understand coding - not just memorize it.

## Quotes

**Rashad West, Creator of BallCODE:**
"Most coding education feels like work. BallCODE is different. Students learn coding through the language they already speak: basketball. When they call a play, they're learning sequences. When they analyze a shot, they're learning probability. They don't realize they're learning coding - they think they're playing basketball."

**Pilot School Teacher (Anonymized):**
"This is the most engaging STEM program I've seen. Students actually understand coding concepts because they can see them in action. The basketball framework makes it accessible to all students, not just those already interested in coding."
