# 🤖 Robot Automation: December 7th Remaining Tasks
## Systematic Completion of ONE Domino: n8n Workflow Operational

**Copyright © 2025 Rashad West. All Rights Reserved.**

**Date:** December 2025  
**Focus:** Get n8n workflow working so we can edit the game with prompts  
**Status:** 🔴 **IN PROGRESS - Robot Working Through Tasks**

---

## 🎯 THE ONE DOMINO

**Goal:** Get n8n workflow working so we can edit the game with prompts

**Why This Matters:**
- If we have integration working and n8n finished, we can edit the game with prompts - we're winning no doubt
- This unlocks game development - can really build out the game with this done
- Game can work alongside the book once this is operational
- Resources to edit game with prompts = game development unblocked

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] n8n workflow executes successfully end-to-end
- [ ] Can send prompt → AI analyzes → Game edits applied → Build triggered
- [ ] Workflow is simplified (fewer nodes = less potential to break)
- [ ] Header image fixed (quick win)
- [ ] Screenshot-to-fix system ready (for fixing n8n issues as they come)
