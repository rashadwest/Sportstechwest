### The Invite

I was fortunate enough to be invited to a [Duke](https://goduke.com/) game with my guy B. Merritt. üèÄ It was an opportunity I could not pass up, especially with the chance to connect with [Jae Lucas](https://goduke.com/staff-directory/jae-lucas/). As part of the experience, I got to meet and chop it up with some of the Duke freshmen, including [Cooper Flagg](https://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/234234/cooper-flagg), [Darren Harris](https://www.espn.com/college-sports/basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/234235/darren-harris), and Slim. Let me tell you, being around these young talents and seeing their energy firsthand is starting to reignite my own passion for being closer to the game.

### Standing Between Levels

One moment stood out, standing on the mini floor between the court and the locker room. üö™ It is a space that gives you a clear view of the divide between programs operating on this level and the rest of college basketball.

When you look at a school like [Duke](https://goduke.com/), it is obvious that the ability to attract talent comes down to two things: facilities and financial backing. College basketball has essentially become professional sports. Players have incredible freedom, with transfer rules that let them switch teams like free agents. It is a great setup for athletes, but it makes me think about the bigger picture.

Each kid could benefit from an advisor, someone to guide them through these decisions so their choices do not negatively impact their futures. Honestly, I would even advocate for a portion of [NIL](https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2021/7/1/name-image-likeness.aspx) money to be put into a trust, so these athletes have something secure to look forward to later in life.

### A Chance Meeting with TJ Ford

Another highlight of the night was meeting [TJ Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Ford) for the first time. ü§ù His son plays for [Incarnate Word](https://uiwcardinals.com/), and TJ himself is now a player performance coach down in Houston. It is always inspiring to see legends of the game continue to give back and influence the next generation of players. His younger son can also play the game at a high level, so it was great meeting him.

### Cameron Indoor Vibes

Being back in [Cameron Indoor Stadium](https://goduke.com/facilities/cameron-indoor-stadium/1) brought back memories. üèüÔ∏è The last time I was there was with my friend [Ryan Kelly](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Kelly_(basketball)>), back when he was playing. The atmosphere? Still the same. The small stadium feel gives it an intimate vibe, but the prestige of Duke basketball is undeniable.

The school has kept up with technology, adding tools like [Noah](https://www.noahbasketball.com/) for shot tracking, but it is not the flashy upgrades that define the space, it is the history. We even did a quick count of how many Duke players have made it to the [NBA](https://www.nba.com/), and I believe the number was around 96. That kind of success speaks volumes about the program‚Äôs legacy.

### The Game and Final Thoughts

The game itself was not the best for either side, but that did not really matter. üéÆ Being in the atmosphere, engaging with fans, and soaking in the energy of a historic program like [Duke](https://goduke.com/) is what makes nights like this memorable.

Whether it was reconnecting with the game, meeting people like [TJ Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Ford), or reflecting on how college basketball is evolving, this experience left me wanting to be around the sport even more. Nights like these remind me why basketball is so much more than a game, it is a culture, a community, and a legacy.
