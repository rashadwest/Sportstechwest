## Decision: Hybrid Approach

After analyzing the three deployment options in the Website Readiness Assessment, the **Hybrid Approach** is recommended.

### Why Hybrid?

The Hybrid Approach balances:
- **Speed:** Get content to pilot school quickly (3-5 days)
- **Quality:** Upgrade to full Unity experience later (1-2 weeks)
- **Flexibility:** Start simple, evolve based on feedback

### Comparison of Options

#### Option A: Simple Web Page (1-3 days)
- ✅ Fast deployment
- ✅ Works immediately
- ❌ Not the full experience
- **Score:** 7/10

#### Option B: Unity WebGL (1-2 weeks)
- ✅ Full interactive experience
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ❌ Takes longer
- **Score:** 8/10

#### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)
- ✅ Get to school quickly
- ✅ Upgrade later with full experience
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- **Score:** 10/10
