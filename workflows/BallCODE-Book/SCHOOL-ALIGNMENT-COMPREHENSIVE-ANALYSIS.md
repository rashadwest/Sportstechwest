- Students can't practice Python concepts

**Fix Needed:**
- Implement Python game mode (script exists, needs integration)
- Create Python exercises for each book
- Build block-to-Python bridge
- Add Python progression tracking

**Alignment Score:** 50% (Curriculum complete, Python game missing)

---

### 4. Books ↔ Python Game

**Current State:**
- ✅ Books teach Python concepts
- ✅ Books reference Python code
- ✅ Books show learning objectives
- ❌ Python game mode doesn't exist to practice
- ❌ Book exercises can't be completed in Python mode
- ❌ No Python code execution from books

**Gap:**
- Books teach concepts but can't be practiced
- Story → Block → Python pathway incomplete
- Missing Python exercise links

**Fix Needed:**
- Implement Python game mode
- Add Python exercise links to books
- Create Python code examples that work in game
- Build book-to-Python game connection

**Alignment Score:** 60% (Books complete, Python game missing)

---

### 5. Website ↔ Everything

**Current State:**
- ✅ Website shows books
- ✅ Website has curriculum pathway (partial)
- ⚠️ Website doesn't show Python progression
- ⚠️ No "For Schools" section
- ⚠️ No standards alignment page
- ⚠️ No professional development preview

**Gap:**
- Missing school-focused content
- No Python mode showcase
- No clear learning pathway visualization
- No teacher resources preview

**Fix Needed:**
- Add "For Schools" section
- Show Python progression clearly
- Add standards alignment page
- Create visual learning pathway
- Add PD preview section

**Alignment Score:** 55% (Website functional but missing school focus)
