## 🚀 PART 1: QUICK START (10 minutes)

### What is BallCODE? (2 minutes)

**Simple Answer:**
"BallCODE teaches coding through basketball stories and games. Students read a story, learn a concept, then practice it in a game."

**The Three-Phase Pathway:**
```
Phase 1: Sports Language (Blocks)
    ↓
Phase 2: Code Bridge (See the Connection)
    ↓
Phase 3: Python Code (Real Programming)
```

**What This Means:**
- **Phase 1:** Students use blocks (like Scratch) - no typing needed
- **Phase 2:** Students see how blocks become code
- **Phase 3:** Students write real Python code (optional)

**You Don't Need to Know Python.** The blocks make it easy.

### The Three Books (3 minutes)

**Book 1: Sequences**
- **Concept:** Steps in order
- **Basketball:** Breaking the press (move → pass → move)
- **Blocks:** START → MOVE → PASS → MOVE
- **Python:** `move_forward()`, `pass_ball()`, `move_to_position()`

**Book 2: Conditionals**
- **Concept:** Making decisions (if/then)
- **Basketball:** Reading defense (if defender near, then crossover)
- **Blocks:** IF DEFENDER NEAR → THEN CROSSOVER → ELSE DRIVE
- **Python:** `if defender_near(): crossover() else: drive()`

**Book 3: Loops**
- **Concept:** Repeating actions
- **Basketball:** In & out dribble (fake left, go right, repeat 3 times)
- **Blocks:** REPEAT 3 TIMES → FAKE LEFT → GO RIGHT
- **Python:** `for i in range(3): fake_left(); go_right()`

### The Game Interface (3 minutes)

**Three-Panel Layout:**
```
┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────┐
│   BLOCKS     │  │     CODE     │  │   COURT │
│   PALETTE    │  │     AREA     │  │   VIEW   │
└──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────┘
```

**How It Works:**
1. **Left Panel:** Available blocks (drag from here)
2. **Center Panel:** Your code (drag blocks here)
3. **Right Panel:** Court view (see it work)

**Simple Process:**
1. Drag blocks from left to center
2. Snap them together (top to bottom)
3. Click RUN
4. Watch player execute on court

### Key Principles (2 minutes)

**Scratch-Style Simplicity:**
- ✅ **Visual Blocks** - No typing needed
- ✅ **Drag & Drop** - Just like LEGO
- ✅ **Immediate Feedback** - See it work instantly
- ✅ **Simple First** - Start with 2-3 blocks, build complexity

**Your Role:**
- You don't need to know Python
- You just need to understand blocks
- You can learn alongside students
- Focus on helping students think through sequences

## 🎮 PART 2: TRY IT YOURSELF (20 minutes)

### Book 1: Sequences (7 minutes)

**Your Task:** Create a sequence to break the press

**Steps:**
1. Open BallCODE game
2. Drag `START` block to code area
3. Drag `MOVE FORWARD` below START
4. Drag `PASS BALL` below MOVE FORWARD
5. Drag `MOVE TO POSITION` below PASS BALL
6. Click RUN
7. Watch player execute the sequence

**What You Learned:**
- Blocks execute top to bottom
- Order matters (can't pass before you move)
- Visual feedback shows it working

**Try This:**
- Change the order - what happens?
- Add more blocks - make it longer
- Remove a block - what breaks?

### Book 2: Conditionals (7 minutes)

**Your Task:** Create a conditional for one-on-one

**Steps:**
1. Drag `START` block
2. Drag `MOVE FORWARD` below START
3. Drag `IF DEFENDER NEAR` below MOVE FORWARD
4. Drag `THEN CROSSOVER` inside the IF block
5. Drag `ELSE DRIVE` in the else branch
6. Click RUN
7. Watch player react to defender

**What You Learned:**
- IF blocks are C-shaped (open to accept blocks)
- THEN = if condition is true
- ELSE = if condition is false
- Player makes decisions based on conditions

**Try This:**
- What happens if defender is near?
- What happens if defender is not near?
- Can you add another IF block?

### Book 3: Loops (6 minutes)

**Your Task:** Create a loop for in & out dribble

**Steps - Manual First:**
1. Drag `START` block
2. Drag `FAKE LEFT` below START
3. Drag `GO RIGHT` below FAKE LEFT
4. Repeat 2 more times (6 blocks total)
5. Click RUN - see it work
6. Notice: Lots of blocks!

**Steps - Then Loop:**
1. Delete those blocks
2. Drag `REPEAT 3 TIMES` block
3. Drag `FAKE LEFT` inside the loop
4. Drag `GO RIGHT` inside the loop
5. Click RUN - see it work
6. Notice: Only 1 block!

**What You Learned:**
- Manual repetition = many blocks
- Loop = one block, repeats inside
- Loops are more efficient
- Same result, less code

**Try This:**
- Change the number (REPEAT 5 TIMES)
- What happens?
- Which is better - manual or loop?

## 🎯 PART 4: PREPARE YOUR FIRST CLASS (15 minutes)

### Choose Your First Book (2 minutes)

**Recommendation:** Start with Book 1 (Sequences)
- Simplest concept
- Easiest to teach
- Builds confidence
- Sets foundation

**Alternative:** If students are advanced, you can start with Book 2 or 3, but Book 1 is recommended.

### Prepare Materials (5 minutes)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Story ready (digital or print)
- [ ] Game access confirmed (devices ready)
- [ ] Lesson plan reviewed
- [ ] Answer keys available (if needed)
- [ ] Assessment rubrics ready

**Quick Setup:**
1. Open BallCODE game on your device
2. Test the exercise you'll use
3. Make sure it works
4. Bookmark the teacher dashboard
5. Have story ready to display/read

### Plan Your First 15 Minutes (5 minutes)

**Opening (5 minutes):**
- "Today we're learning coding through basketball!"
- "Have you ever given directions? That's a sequence!"
- "Let's see how this works in code."

**Story Reading (10 minutes):**
- Read Book 1, Episode 1 together
- Pause to discuss: "What sequence did you notice?"
- Connect to coding: "This is how code works - step by step."

### Anticipate Questions (3 minutes)

**Common Student Questions:**

**Q: "What if I get it wrong?"**
A: "That's okay! Debugging is part of coding. Try again, see what happens."

**Q: "Why does order matter?"**
A: "Just like giving directions - you can't turn left before you go straight. Code works the same way."

**Q: "Do I need to know Python?"**
A: "Not yet! We're using blocks first. You'll see Python later, but blocks are enough for now."

**Q: "What if I finish early?"**
A: "Great! Try creating your own sequence. Or help a classmate. Or try the Python code."

**Q: "What if I'm stuck?"**
A: "Ask a classmate. Or ask me. Or use the hints in the game. We're all learning together."

### Your Teaching Approach (2 minutes)

**Remember:**
- ✅ You don't need to know Python
- ✅ You can learn alongside students
- ✅ Focus on helping students think
- ✅ Celebrate mistakes (debugging is learning)
- ✅ Keep it simple (2-3 blocks to start)

**Your Role:**
- Guide, don't lecture
- Ask questions, don't give answers
- Encourage experimentation
- Celebrate successes
- Help when stuck

## ✅ QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

### Book 1: Sequences Quick Reference

**Concept:** Steps in order

**Blocks:**
```
START
  → MOVE FORWARD
  → PASS BALL
  → MOVE TO POSITION
```

**Key Points:**
- Order matters
- Top to bottom execution
- Visual blocks make it obvious

**Common Mistakes:**
- Wrong order (pass before move)
- Missing blocks
- Too many blocks (overcomplicate)

**How to Help:**
- "What happens first? Then what?"
- "Can you put PASS before MOVE? What happens?"
- "Try it and see!"

### Book 2: Conditionals Quick Reference

**Concept:** If this, then that

**Blocks:**
```
START
  → MOVE FORWARD
  → IF DEFENDER NEAR
      THEN CROSSOVER
      ELSE DRIVE
```

**Key Points:**
- IF block is C-shaped
- Condition goes at top
- THEN = if true
- ELSE = if false

**Common Mistakes:**
- Missing ELSE branch
- Wrong condition
- Blocks in wrong place

**How to Help:**
- "What happens if defender is near?"
- "What happens if defender is not near?"
- "Try it and see!"

### Book 3: Loops Quick Reference

**Concept:** Repeating actions

**Manual (Before Loop):**
```
START
  → FAKE LEFT
  → GO RIGHT
  → FAKE LEFT
  → GO RIGHT
  → FAKE LEFT
  → GO RIGHT
```

**Loop (After Loop):**
```
START
  → REPEAT 3 TIMES
      FAKE LEFT
      GO RIGHT
```

**Key Points:**
- Show manual first (builds understanding)
- Then show loop (shows efficiency)
- Loops are more efficient
- Same result, less code

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting blocks inside loop
- Wrong number of repeats
- Not understanding repetition

**How to Help:**
- "How many times does it repeat?"
- "Which is better - manual or loop?"
- "Try changing the number - what happens?"

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Technical Issues

**Game Won't Load:**
- Check internet connection
- Try different browser
- Clear cache
- Contact support

**Blocks Won't Snap:**
- Make sure you're dragging to code area
- Check if block fits (some blocks only fit in certain places)
- Try refreshing page

**Code Won't Run:**
