## Main Crew
- Nova (PG, protagonist): fast processor, sees the court like code; leadership arc.
- Atlas (Wing): strength and balance; screens and cuts with precision.
- Pixel (Guard): sharpshooter; pattern-spotter; comic relief.
- Anchor (Big): seals space; protects paint; gentle giant.
- Coach Circuit: mentor who translates basketball into code language.
- Arc (AI assistant): gives hints with confidence + why; never replaces decisions.

## Antagonists / Monsters
- Shadow Press Scouts: create chaos in transition; punish bad state.
- Turnover Trolls: bait risky passes; punish poor conditionals.
- Rotation Wraiths: appear where rotations are late.
- Zone Phantoms: morphing shapes; test pattern recognition.
- Data Golems: rigid rules; test modeling quality.
- Hedge Hydra: multi-headed screen coverage; requires counters.
- Substitution Sprites: scramble lineups; test constraints.
- Variance Viper: hot/cold streak illusions; tests EV thinking.
- Shot Clock Titan: compresses time; tests algorithm choice.
- Glitch Gremlins: hide in habits; cause repeatable errors.
- Entropy Elemental: dissolves meaning; tests schema quality.
- Uncertainty Chimera: mixes noise and signal; tests AI guardrails.

## World Rules (Basketball → Code)
- Advantage Gauge: increases with space/tempo; decreases with turnovers.
- Gravity Field: shooters bend defenders; stored as a rating.
- Tempo Meter: pace of play; affects latency and decision budgets.
- Coding Spells:
  - If/Else = Split Decision
  - Loop = Rotation Ritual
  - Function = Set Call
  - Array = Roster Ring
  - Schema = Meaning Map
- AI-in-the-loop: Arc can propose, but players decide. Always require:
  - Confidence score
  - Why explanation
  - Fallback action

## Visual Assets Checklist

- Monster character sheets (silhouette + color)
- Play diagrams per episode
- Code blocks/pseudocode visuals

## Style Notes
- Voice: energetic, respectful, clever; jokes land without sarcasm.
