## 🔧 SOLUTIONS

### Method 1: Pin/Star Current Chat (Recommended)
1. In the chat sidebar, find your current active chat
2. Look for a **pin/star icon** next to the chat name
3. Click it to pin the chat to the top
4. This keeps your active chat visible while others are below

### Method 2: Archive/Close Other Chats
1. Right-click on chat conversations you don't need
2. Look for **"Archive"** or **"Close"** option
3. This removes them from the active sidebar view
4. You can still access them later if needed

### Method 3: Use Chat Search/Filter
1. Look for a **search box** at the top of the chat sidebar
2. Type keywords from your current chat
3. This filters to show only matching conversations
4. Clear search to see all again

### Method 4: Start Fresh Chat
1. Click **"New Chat"** button (usually at top of sidebar)
2. This creates a new conversation
3. Previous chats move down in the list
4. Focus on the new chat at the top

### Method 5: Collapse Chat History
1. Look for a **collapse/expand arrow** in the chat sidebar
2. Click to collapse the chat history section
3. This hides the list of previous chats
4. Only shows your current active chat
