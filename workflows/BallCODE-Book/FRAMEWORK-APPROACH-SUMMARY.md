# Framework Approach Summary
## Basketball Stories Teach AI, Math, and Coding

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING SAVED TO MEMORY**

---

## The Core Principle

**Basketball = Language/Framework**  
**Coding + Math + AI = What Students Learn**

**CRITICAL:** Basketball is the language/framework for teaching BOTH coding AND math equally. We are NOT teaching basketball. We are using basketball as the language to teach coding concepts AND math concepts through engaging stories. Students learn coding and math THROUGH basketball, not ABOUT basketball. Then students practice these concepts in the BallCODE game.

## How It Works

### 1. Basketball Story (Framework)
- Engaging narrative that students want to read
- Basketball situations and terminology used naturally
- 3-act structure: Act I (setup), Act II (struggle), Act III (resolution)
- 70% story, 30% skill inserts

### 2. Concepts Emerge Naturally (Coding AND Math)
- **Coding concepts** emerge FROM basketball needs (e.g., "We need to repeat this move" → loops, "We need to make a decision" → conditionals)
- **Math concepts** solve basketball problems (e.g., "What's our best shot?" → expected value, probability, statistics, "How many points per possession?" → ratios, percentages)
- **AI concepts** enhance basketball decisions (e.g., "We need to see where the ball is" → computer vision, "What pattern does the defense use?" → pattern recognition)
- **Basketball is the language** - students learn coding AND math concepts through basketball terminology and situations

### 3. Basketball Success = Proof of Learning
- Characters use AI/math/coding to solve basketball problems
- Basketball success demonstrates concept mastery
- Students see practical application immediately

### 4. Practice in Game
- After story, students practice concepts in BallCODE game
- Game exercises use basketball scenarios
- Students apply what they learned from the story

## The Three-Act Structure (3 Buckets)

Every episode MUST follow this structure:

### Act I: Setup and Problem
- Start with basketball action
- Introduce basketball challenge
- Hint at concepts but don't explain yet

### Act II: Learning and Struggle
- Basketball challenge intensifies
- Concepts emerge from basketball needs
- Characters learn to use concepts

### Act III: Resolution and Application
- Characters apply concepts to basketball
- Basketball success achieved
- Connection made clear

## Rules Updated

### .cursorrules
- Added "Basketball Story Framework (CRITICAL)" section
- Clarified basketball = framework, not subject
- Added story writing rules

### CURSOR-PROFILE-CONTEXT.md
- Added framework clarification
- Emphasized basketball as vehicle

## What This Means for Story Writers

### ✅ DO:
- Start every scene with basketball action
- Use basketball terminology naturally
- Show concepts emerging from basketball needs
- Follow 3-act structure
- Make basketball success the goal

### ❌ DON'T:
- Start with "Today we're learning about X"
- Explain concepts before basketball context
- Make basketball secondary
- Break 3-act structure
- Make story feel like a lesson

---

## Example: Correct vs. Wrong

### ❌ WRONG:
"Today we're learning about state management. State is when something can be in different conditions. In basketball, the ball can be in different states..."

### ✅ CORRECT:
"The ball bounced between players, each touch creating chaos. Nova's head spun trying to track it all. 'What's the current state?' Coach Circuit asked. Nova blinked. 'I don't know! It's changing too fast!' 

That's when Arc chimed in: 'State shift detected. Current state: DEAD. Previous state: LIVE. I can track the shifts, but you must confirm.' 

Nova looked at the court. The ball was on the ground. 'Yes,' she said. 'State is DEAD. Confirmed.' 

Now she could see it—the state of the game, written in code that only she could read. START. LIVE. DEAD. OUTCOME. If she could track the state correctly, they could control the game."

**Key Difference:** Basketball situation comes first, concepts emerge naturally.

## Memory Saved

This understanding is now saved:
- Basketball stories are the FRAMEWORK for teaching
- AI, math, and coding are what students LEARN
- Every episode must follow 3-act structure
- Concepts must emerge from basketball needs
- Basketball success proves concept mastery
- Stories must be engaging (70% story, 30% skill)
