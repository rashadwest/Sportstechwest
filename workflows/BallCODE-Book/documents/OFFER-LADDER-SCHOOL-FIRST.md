# BallCODE School-First Offer Ladder (Pilot → Annual License)

**Purpose:** Provide a procurement-friendly, school-first way to buy BallCODE (so we are not selling “$5 books” as the primary model).

## Positioning (what schools are buying)
BallCODE is an integrated literacy + STEM pathway:
- **Books (story-driven learning)** + **short interactive game challenges (60–90s)**
- A consistent **Blocks → Bridge → Python** progression
- Teacher-ready implementation + measurable progress (Telemetry as the proof layer)

## Buyer flow
1. **School tries a pilot** (low/no cost, time-boxed)
2. **School converts to annual license** (classroom or site)
3. **School emails parents** with access + optional home continuation

---

## Tier 0 — Pilot (time-boxed, fastest “yes”)
**Goal:** Remove risk and collect proof (teacher feedback + student engagement + outcomes).

**Price anchor:** $0 (recommended for first pilot cohort) or $250 for “supported pilot” (if you need friction to filter).

**Length:** 2–4 weeks (recommended) or 6–8 weeks (if school needs longer).

**Includes:**
- Book/Episode 1 module (story + 3 challenges)
- Teacher quick-start + lesson flow
- Student access method (codes/links)
- Light support cadence (email/office hours)

**Conversion target:** Pilot → Annual within 10 business days after pilot summary.

---

## Tier 1 — Classroom Annual License (teacher-led)
**Who buys:** a principal, department chair, or a teacher with budget.

**Ideal for:** one classroom, after-school club, or elective.

**Recommended anchor:** **$1,499 / year per classroom** (up to ~35 students).

**Includes:**
- Access to the BallCODE book modules included in the current release (starting with Book/Episode 1, expanding as releases ship)
- Game challenges mapped to the curriculum schema
- Teacher implementation guide + checklists
- Parent email templates (school sends)
- Basic progress reporting (Telemetry v1)

**Add-on:** additional classroom packs at a discounted rate (e.g., $999/classroom).

---

## Tier 2 — School/Site Annual License (principal-friendly)
**Who buys:** principal / school leadership.

**Ideal for:** whole building, STEM program, multi-class rollout.

**Recommended anchor:** **$4,999 / year per school** (tiered by enrollment if needed).

**Includes:**
- Everything in Classroom Annual
- Unlimited teachers at the site
- School rollout kit (1-hour onboarding + implementation plan)
- School-level readiness report (pilot → proof → renewal)
- Priority support window during onboarding

**Optional tiering (if needed later):**
- Small (≤300 students): $3,999/year
- Medium (301–800): $4,999/year
- Large (801+): $6,999/year

---

## Tier 3 — District License (custom)
**Who buys:** district curriculum/innovation/technology leadership.

**Recommended anchor:** **Starts at $15,000 / year**, scoped by number of schools and support level.

**Includes:**
- Multi-school rollout
- District reporting roll-up
- Implementation support plan + training schedule
- Custom procurement requirements (SOW, security, privacy)

---

## Parent continuation (school-led distribution)
**Default strategy:** Schools purchase first, then email parents.

**Home continuation offer (optional):**
- Parent bundle/subscription (best for multi-child households)
- Parent access codes distributed through the school

**Keep $5/book:** only as a low-friction consumer entry point (not the core school model).

---

## Renewal logic (what makes it easy to renew)
Schools renew when they have proof of:
- student engagement (completion rates)
- teacher ease-of-implementation
- measurable progress (Telemetry v1 outputs)

**Robot job:** generate a simple renewal-ready report automatically.

---

## What we will display on the website (school-first)
- A “For Schools” section with: Pilot → Classroom → Site → District
- A “Request a Pilot” CTA (primary)
- Parent purchase options as secondary (post-school adoption)
