## Executive Summary

BallCODE is an innovative educational program that teaches coding, mathematics, and AI concepts through basketball narratives and interactive gameplay. The curriculum combines story-based learning (Duolingo-style) with visual block coding (Scratch-style) to create an engaging, accessible pathway from sports language to Python programming.

**Target Audience:** Elementary & Middle school students (grades 3-8)  
**Format:** 12 self-contained episodes with integrated game exercises  
**Approach:** 70% story, 30% skill instruction with hands-on practice  
**Unique Value:** First-of-its-kind sports-to-code learning pathway

## Curriculum Structure

### Learning Pathway Overview

The BallCODE curriculum follows a progressive three-phase learning pathway:

1. **Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)**
   - Students learn coding concepts using basketball terminology
   - Visual block interface (no typing required)
   - Immediate feedback through game integration

2. **Phase 2: Transition Bridge**
   - Students see how sports language maps to code concepts
   - Side-by-side view of blocks and code
   - Understanding that blocks = code

3. **Phase 3: Python Learning Option**
   - Students can progress to Python syntax
   - Same concepts, different representation
   - Real-world programming skills
