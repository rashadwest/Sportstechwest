## 💡 Key Reminders

1. **Basketball is the framework** - Start with basketball action (Zhang)
2. **AI/Math/Coding emerge FROM basketball** - Don't explain concepts first (Zhang)
3. **3-act structure is mandatory** - Act I, Act II, Act III
4. **Students build to learn** - Include hands-on activities (Resnick)
5. **Multiple entry points** - Story, game, code, visual (Reggio)
6. **Build systematically** - Connect to previous episodes (Hassabis)
7. **Keep it simple** - Beautiful, intuitive design (Jobs)
8. **Quality over speed** - Better to have 2 perfect books than 3 rushed ones
9. **You own the stories** - I provide structure, you write the content
