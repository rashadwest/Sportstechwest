## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE

**Subject:** Request: Transfer BTEBallCODE Netlify Site

---

Hi [Developer Name],

I'm setting up automated deployments for the BTEBallCODE Unity game and need access to the Netlify site.

**Could you please transfer the Netlify site to my account?**

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select the BTEBallCODE site
3. Go to: **Site settings** → **General**
4. Scroll to **"Transfer site ownership"** section
5. Click **"Transfer site"**
6. Enter my email: **[YOUR_EMAIL]**
7. Confirm the transfer

**I'll receive an email to accept the transfer.**

**Alternative (if transfer isn't available right now):**

If you can't transfer immediately, could you:
- Add me as a **collaborator** on the site?
- Go to: Site settings → **Members**
- Add: **[YOUR_EMAIL]**

This will give me access to get the Site ID I need for automation.

---

**Why I need this:**
- Setting up automated Unity builds → GitHub Actions → Netlify
- Need the Site ID to check deployment status
- Won't affect existing setup - just need read access

**Thanks!**

[Your Name]
