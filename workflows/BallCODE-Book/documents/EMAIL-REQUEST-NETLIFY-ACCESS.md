## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE

**Subject:** Request: Netlify Access for BallCODE Website (ballcode.co)

Hey [Name],

Following up on the GitHub repository request - I also need Netlify access for the BallCODE website deployment.

**What I need:**
- Access to the Netlify account/site for `ballcode.co`
- This will allow me to manage deployments directly
- I can set up automated deployments from GitHub

**Why this is needed:**
- I've automated the deployment process and need direct Netlify access
- This will enable faster updates and better workflow management
- I'll be able to trigger deployments and monitor build status directly

**Options for Access:**

**Option 1: Add me to Netlify Team (Preferred)**
- Add my email to the Netlify team for the site
- This gives me full access to manage deployments
- I can set up build hooks and automation

**Option 2: Share Netlify Credentials**
- Share the Netlify account credentials
- I can set up API access for automated deployments
- This allows full control over the deployment process

**Option 3: Create Netlify API Token**
- Generate a Netlify API token for me
- I can use this for automated deployments
- This is the most secure option

**Moving Forward:**

Once I have Netlify access:
- I'll set up automated deployments from GitHub
- The website will update automatically on every push
- I can monitor and manage all deployments
- Everything will be ready for launch

**Timeline:**
- I'm ready to take this over immediately
- Once I have access, I can have everything set up within 24 hours
- This will complete the automation setup

Please let me know which access method works best for you, or if you need any additional information.

Thanks,
Rashad
