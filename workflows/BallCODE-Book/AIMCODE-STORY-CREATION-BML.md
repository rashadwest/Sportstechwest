## Integrating AIMCODE Methodology with Story Development

**PROJECT IDENTIFIER:** `BALLCODE-BOOK-AIMCODE-STORY-BML-v1.0`  
**Purpose:** Apply AIMCODE methodology to story creation with integrated BML feedback loop  
**Last Updated:** December 2025

## Overview

This workflow applies the AIMCODE Build-Measure-Learn cycle specifically to story creation, ensuring stories are created using AIMCODE principles, measured for effectiveness, and continuously improved based on learnings.

---

## BUILD Phase: Story Creation with AIMCODE

### Step 1: CLEAR Framework

**C - Clarity:**
- What story are we creating? (Episode number, title)
- What are the learning objectives?
- What coding/math/AI concepts will be taught?
- What basketball situation will be the framework?
- What is the target audience?

**L - Logic:**
- How does this story build on previous episodes?
- What is the systematic progression?
- How do concepts layer on each other?
- What is the logical flow?

**E - Examples:**
- What examples from previous stories worked well?
- What case studies inform this story?
- What similar educational stories can we reference?
- What basketball scenarios illustrate the concepts?

**A - Adaptation:**
- What constraints exist? (Word count, complexity, etc.)
- What flexibility is needed?
- How might we need to adapt during creation?
- What feedback from previous stories should we incorporate?

**R - Results:**
- How will we measure story success?
- What metrics will we track?
- What does success look like?
- What are the success criteria?

**Deliverable:** CLEAR framework document with all components defined

---

### Step 2: Alpha Evolve (Hassabis - Systematic Deep Learning)

**Layer 1: Basketball Foundation**
- Start with basketball action/situation
- Establish basketball problem/challenge
- Make basketball success the goal
- Use basketball terminology naturally

**Layer 2: Concept Introduction**
- Show AI/math/coding concepts emerging FROM basketball needs
- Don't explain concepts before showing them in context
- Make concepts solve basketball problems
- Connect concepts to basketball actions

**Layer 3: Learning Integration**
- Integrate learning objectives naturally
- Connect to previous episodes
- Build on established concepts
- Create learning progression

**Layer 4: Game Integration**
- Design story→game transition points
- Create exercise connection points
- Ensure seamless flow
- Make game success = proof of learning

**Deliverable:** Story outline with all layers defined

---

### Step 3: PhD-Level Peer-Reviewed Research

**Research Tier 2 (15 minutes):**
- Narrative learning research
- Educational storytelling principles
- Basketball-based learning research
- Concept introduction best practices

**Key Research Areas:**
- How stories enhance learning
- When to introduce concepts
- How to maintain engagement
- What makes educational stories effective

**Deliverable:** Research summary with key findings applied

---

### Step 4: Expert Consultation (AIMCODE Advisory Board)

**Zhang (Story-First):**
- Does story start with basketball action?
- Do concepts emerge from narrative?
- Is story engaging, not didactic?
- Does basketball success = proof of learning?

**Resnick (Constructionist):**
- Are there building activities?
- Can students create something?
- Is there hands-on engagement?
- Are exercises constructionist?

**Reggio (Multiple Entry Points):**
- Are there multiple ways to engage?
- Can students choose their path?
- Is there visual, textual, interactive content?
- Are different learning styles supported?

**Hassabis (Systems Thinking):**
- Does story build systematically?
- Are concepts connected?
- Is there deep understanding?
- Does it build on previous episodes?

**Jobs (Simplicity):**
- Is story simple and clear?
- Does it "just work"?
- Is design beautiful?
- Is there unnecessary complexity removed?

**Deliverable:** Expert validation checklist completed

---

### Step 5: Story Writing

**Act I: Setup and Problem**
- Start with basketball action
- Introduce basketball challenge
- Hint at concepts but don't explain
- Create engagement and curiosity

**Act II: Learning and Struggle**
- Basketball challenge intensifies
- Concepts emerge from basketball needs
- Characters learn to use concepts
- Show struggle and learning process

**Act III: Resolution and Application**
- Characters apply concepts to basketball
- Basketball success achieved
- Connection made clear
- Learning demonstrated

**Deliverable:** Complete story draft

---

## MEASURE Phase: Story Effectiveness Metrics

### Story Engagement Metrics
- **Page Views**: Track which pages are viewed
- **Time per Page**: How long users spend on each page
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage who complete the story
- **Drop-off Points**: Where users stop reading

### Story→Game Integration Metrics
- **Play Exercise Click Rate**: Percentage who click "Play Exercise"
- **Transition Success**: Successful story→game transitions
- **Return Rate**: Percentage who return to story after exercise
- **Integration Health**: Overall flow success

### Learning Outcome Metrics
- **Concept Understanding**: Do users understand concepts?
- **Application Success**: Can users apply concepts in game?
- **Retention**: Do users remember concepts?
- **Progression**: Do users progress to next episode?

### User Feedback
- **Qualitative Feedback**: What do users say?
- **Teacher Observations**: What do teachers notice?
- **Expert Reviews**: What do experts think?
- **Student Responses**: How do students react?

**Deliverable:** Metrics summary with key findings

---

## LEARN Phase: Story Analysis and Refinement

### Analysis Questions

**What Worked?**
- Which story elements engaged users?
- What improved game integration?
- What enhanced learning outcomes?
- What made concepts clear?

**What Didn't?**
- Where did users lose engagement?
- What confused users?
- What didn't connect to game?
- What didn't enhance learning?

**Why?**
- Root cause analysis
- What made things work/not work?
- What patterns emerged?
- What can we learn?

**How to Improve?**
- What changes should we make?
- How to improve next story?
- What to keep/remove/add?
- How to refine AIMCODE process?

### AIMCODE Refinement

**CLEAR Refinement:**
- Were objectives clear enough?
- Did logic hold?
- Did examples help?
- What adaptations were needed?
- Did results match expectations?

**Alpha Evolve Refinement:**
- Which layers worked best?
- Where did progression break?
- What connections emerged?
- How to improve layering?

**Research Refinement:**
- Did research predictions hold?
- What new research needed?
- What research was most helpful?
- How to better apply research?

**Expert Refinement:**
- Which expert principles worked best?
- Where did they fall short?
- What new expert insights needed?
- How to better apply expert guidance?

**Deliverable:** Learnings document with improvements for next story
