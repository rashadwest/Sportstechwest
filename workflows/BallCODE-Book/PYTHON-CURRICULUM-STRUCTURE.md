# Python Curriculum Structure
## How BallCODE Books Teach Python Through Basketball

**Copyright © 2025 Rashad West. All Rights Reserved.**

**Date:** December 3, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define Python curriculum structure for IBM presentation and school meetings  
**Target:** IBM SkillsBuild integration + STEM school adoption

---

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

**Basketball is the LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK, not the subject being taught. This applies to BOTH coding AND math equally.**

- **Basketball = Language/Framework** - The engaging narrative that makes learning accessible
- **Coding + Math + AI = What Students Learn** - Concepts taught through basketball stories
- **CRITICAL:** Basketball is the language students use to understand BOTH coding AND math concepts. Students learn coding and math THROUGH basketball, not ABOUT basketball.
- **Every book must:**
  1. Start with basketball action/situation (not concept explanation)
  2. Show coding concepts emerging FROM basketball needs (e.g., "We need to repeat this" → loops)
  3. Show math concepts solving basketball problems (e.g., "What's our best shot?" → probability, expected value)
  4. Follow 3-act structure: Act I (setup/problem), Act II (struggle/learning), Act III (resolution/success)
  5. Make basketball success the proof of concept mastery (for BOTH coding AND math)
  6. Keep story engaging and adventurous (70% story, 30% skill inserts)

## 📚 THREE-PHASE LEARNING PATHWAY

### Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding + Math)
**What students do:**
- Learn coding concepts AND math concepts using basketball terminology
- Visual block interface (no typing required)
- Drag blocks together to create programs AND perform math calculations
- Immediate feedback through integrated game exercises

**Coding concepts introduced:**
- Sequences (Book 1)
- Conditionals (Book 2)
- Loops (Book 3)
- Functions (Future books)

**Math concepts introduced:**
- Counting, basic statistics (Book 1)
- Probability, decision-making math (Book 2)
- Pattern analysis, ratios, percentages (Book 3)

**How it works:**
- **Coding:** Students see blocks like "IF defender goes left, THEN crossover right"
- **Math:** Students see blocks like "CALCULATE best shot probability" or "COUNT points per possession"
- No Python syntax or complex math formulas yet - just concepts through blocks
- Basketball terminology makes BOTH coding AND math accessible

---

### Phase 2: Transition Bridge (Coding + Math)
**What students do:**
- See how sports language maps to code concepts AND math concepts
- Side-by-side view of blocks and code/math
- Understand that blocks = code AND blocks = math
- See Python syntax AND math formulas alongside blocks

**Coding concepts reinforced:**
- Same concepts from Phase 1, now with syntax
- Students see: "This block = this Python code"
- Understanding deepens: "Code is just instructions"

**Math concepts reinforced:**
- Same concepts from Phase 1, now with formulas
- Students see: "This block = this math calculation"
- Understanding deepens: "Math is just problem-solving"

**How it works:**
- **Coding:** Visual comparison: Block on left, Python code on right
  - Students see: `if defender_goes_left: crossover_right()`
- **Math:** Visual comparison: Block on left, math formula on right
  - Students see: `best_shot_probability = calculate_expected_value(shot_data)`
- Connection made: "Oh, this is the same thing!" (for BOTH coding AND math)

---

### Phase 3: Python Learning + Math Application
**What students do:**
- Progress to Python syntax AND math application
- Same concepts, different representation
- Real-world programming skills AND real-world math skills
- Write actual Python code AND apply math concepts

**Coding concepts mastered:**
- Sequences: `print("Hello")`
- Conditionals: `if condition: action()`
- Loops: `for i in range(10):`
- Functions: `def function_name():`

**Math concepts mastered:**
- Basic statistics: Counting, averages, data collection
- Probability: Expected value, decision-making math
- Pattern analysis: Ratios, percentages, data interpretation

**How it works:**
- **Coding:** Students write Python code to solve basketball problems
  - Same basketball context, now with real code
  - "I can code! This is Python!"
- **Math:** Students apply math concepts to basketball data
  - Same basketball context, now with real math
  - "I can calculate! This is probability/statistics!"

### Book 3: The Pattern (In & Out Dribble) - UPDATED
**Basketball Context:** Repeated moves, patterns, deception + **Data-driven strategy**  
**Python Concept:** Loops and repetition + **Data fetching and analysis**

**What students learn:**
- **Block Coding:** REPEAT blocks, loops + **Data fetching blocks**
- **Python Foundation:** `for` loops, `while` loops + **Data analysis**
- **Concept:** Repetition - do something multiple times + **Data helps find patterns**

**Python Code Example:**
```python
# Pattern repetition - loops
for move in range(3):
    fake_left()
    go_right()
    if defender_falls_for_fake:
        break

# NEW: Data fetching and analysis
opponent_data = fetch_opponent_stats()  # Simplified
for game in opponent_data:
    if game.reaction == "left":
        left_count += 1
# Pattern: 87% left reactions
```
