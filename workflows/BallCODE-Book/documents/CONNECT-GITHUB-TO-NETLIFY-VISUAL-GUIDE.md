## 🎯 YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE RIGHT PLACE!

I can see you're on the **"Project configuration"** page. Perfect! Here's exactly what to do:

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP (Based on Your Dashboard)

### **Step 1: You're Already Here ✅**

You're on the **"Project configuration"** page. I can see:
- Left sub-panel showing configuration options
- "Build & deploy" section visible
- "Continuous deployment" listed under it

---

### **Step 2: Click "Continuous deployment"**

1. In the **left sub-panel** (where you see "Project configuration" options)
2. Look for the **"Build & deploy"** section
3. Click on **"Continuous deployment"** (it's listed there)

---

### **Step 3: Connect to GitHub**

1. After clicking "Continuous deployment", you'll see:
   - **"Link to Git provider"** button (if not connected)
   - OR **"Connected to Git"** status (if already connected)

2. **Click "Link to Git provider"**
   - Select **"GitHub"**
   - You'll be redirected to authorize Netlify
   - Click **"Authorize Netlify"**

---

### **Step 4: Select Repository**

1. After authorizing, you'll see a list of repositories
2. Find and select: **`rashadwest/BallCode`**
3. Click on it

---

### **Step 5: Configure Settings**

1. **Branch to deploy:** Select **`main`**
2. **Build command:** Leave empty (static site)
3. **Publish directory:** Leave empty (root directory)
4. Click **"Save"**

---

### **Step 6: Verify**

1. Go back to "Continuous deployment"
2. You should see:
   - ✅ **"Connected to Git"**
   - Repository: `rashadwest/BallCode`
   - Branch: `main`

---

## 🔍 ALTERNATIVE: If You Don't See "Continuous deployment"

**If the left sub-panel doesn't show "Build & deploy":**

1. Look at the **top navigation** in the main content area
2. You should see tabs like:
   - "Project overview" (current)
   - "Project configuration" (you're here)
   - "Deploys"
   - "Logs & metrics"
   - etc.

3. **OR** look for a **"Build & deploy"** link in the main navigation tabs
