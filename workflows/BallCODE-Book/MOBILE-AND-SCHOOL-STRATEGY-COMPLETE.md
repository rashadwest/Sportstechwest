### Critical Gaps for School Appeal

#### Gap 1: Python Game Mode Missing ❌
**Impact:** CRITICAL
- Curriculum expects Python mode
- Books reference Python exercises
- Students can't practice Python concepts
- Incomplete learning pathway

**Fix:** Implement Python game mode (3-4 weeks)

#### Gap 2: Website Missing School Focus ⚠️
**Impact:** HIGH
- No "For Schools" section
- No standards alignment page
- No visual learning pathway
- No teacher resources preview

**Fix:** Add school-focused content (1 week)

#### Gap 3: Python Not in PD Guide ⚠️
**Impact:** MEDIUM
- PD guide only covers blocks
- No Python training materials
- No transition guide

**Fix:** Update PD guide (3-5 days)
