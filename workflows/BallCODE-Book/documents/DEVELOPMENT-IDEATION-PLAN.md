## 🎯 IDEATION FOCUS AREAS

### **1. Visual Assets System** 🎨
**Problem:** Visual assets are critical blocker (0% complete)

**Ideation:**
- **Option A:** Manual generation (DALL-E, Midjourney, Glif)
  - Pros: High quality, full control
  - Cons: Time-consuming, manual work
  - Time: 2-3 hours

- **Option B:** Automated placeholder system
  - Pros: Fast, can replace later
  - Cons: Not final quality
  - Time: 30 minutes

- **Option C:** Template-based generation
  - Pros: Consistent, scalable
  - Cons: May need customization
  - Time: 1-2 hours

**Recommendation:** Option A (manual) for launch quality, Option B for speed

**Problem:** Learning loop is 70% complete, needs completion

**Ideation:**
- **MVP Approach:**
  - Simple "What You Learned" text sections
  - Basic "Next Book" links
