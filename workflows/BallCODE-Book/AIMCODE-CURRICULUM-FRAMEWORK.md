## PHASE 1: CLEAR Framework (Curriculum-Specific)

### C - Clarity: Curriculum Objectives

**Questions to Ask:**
- What is the learning pathway? (Phase 1: Blocks → Phase 2: Bridge → Phase 3: Python)
- What are the grade-level targets? (Grades 3-5, 6-8, 9-12)
- What standards are we aligning with? (CSTA, Common Core, NGSS)
- What is the progression structure? (Book → Game → Python)
- What are the learning outcomes? (Measurable, assessable)

**Curriculum-Specific Clarity:**
- **Three-Phase Learning Pathway:**
  - Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)
  - Phase 2: Transition Bridge (Blocks → Python)
  - Phase 3: Python Learning (Actual Code)
- **Grade-Level Progression:**
  - Grades 3-5: Foundation, basics, visual coding
  - Grades 6-8: Intermediate, concepts, transition
  - Grades 9-12: Advanced, mastery, real-world application
- **Integration Points:**
  - Book → Game → Python (seamless flow)
  - Curriculum → Standards → Assessment (aligned)

### L - Logic: Curriculum Structure

**Questions to Ask:**
- How do concepts build systematically? (Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3)
- How do books connect to games? (Specific exercises, code integration)
- How do games connect to Python? (Code translation, application)
- How does grade-level progression work? (Foundation → Intermediate → Advanced)
- How do standards align with content? (CSTA → Concepts, Common Core → Math, NGSS → Science)

**Curriculum-Specific Logic:**
- **Layer 1:** Foundation (basic concepts, visual coding, sports language)
- **Layer 2:** Application (game exercises, block → Python bridge)
- **Layer 3:** Mastery (Python coding, real-world application)
- **Layer 4:** Integration (books + games + Python = complete pathway)
- **Layer 5:** Assessment (measuring learning, progression tracking)

### E - Examples: Curriculum Case Studies

**Questions to Ask:**
- What curriculum frameworks work well? (Scratch, Code.org, Khan Academy)
- What learning pathways are effective? (Visual → Text, Blocks → Code)
- What standards alignment strategies work? (CSTA progression, Common Core integration)
- What assessment methods are effective? (Formative, summative, project-based)

**Curriculum-Specific Examples:**
- Scratch curriculum (visual → text progression)
- Code.org courses (grade-level progression, standards alignment)
- Khan Academy CS (systematic concept building)
- CSTA standards (K-12 progression, concept mapping)

### A - Adaptation: Curriculum Flexibility

**Questions to Ask:**
- What constraints exist? (Time, resources, grade-level requirements)
- What flexibility is needed? (Different learning styles, pacing, entry points)
- How do we adapt for different learners? (Scaffolding, differentiation, support)
- What feedback should we incorporate? (Student needs, teacher feedback, assessment results)

**Curriculum-Specific Adaptation:**
- Different learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Pacing flexibility (self-paced, guided, accelerated)
- Entry points (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Support levels (scaffolding, hints, extensions)

### R - Results: Curriculum Success Metrics

**Questions to Ask:**
- How do we measure learning progression? (Assessment scores, concept mastery)
- How do we measure pathway effectiveness? (Completion rates, success rates)
- How do we measure standards alignment? (Coverage, depth, progression)
- How do we measure integration success? (Book → Game → Python flow)

**Curriculum-Specific Results:**
- **Learning Metrics:**
  - Concept mastery: >75%
  - Progression rate: Appropriate for grade level
  - Assessment scores: >70% passing
- **Pathway Metrics:**
  - Book → Game transition: >60% click rate
  - Game → Python transition: >50% completion
  - Overall pathway completion: >70%
- **Standards Metrics:**
  - CSTA alignment: 100% coverage
  - Common Core alignment: Grade-appropriate
  - NGSS alignment: Where applicable

### Layer 3: Application (Phase 3: Python)
**Focus:** Actual Python coding, real-world skills
- Writing Python code
- Same concepts, different representation
- Real-world programming skills
- Mastery and independence

### Layer 4: Integration (Book → Game → Python)
**Focus:** Seamless flow between all components
- Book introduces concept
- Game exercises concept
- Python applies concept
- Complete learning cycle

### Layer 5: Assessment (Measuring Learning)
**Focus:** Formative and summative assessment, progression tracking
- Concept understanding assessment
- Code application assessment
- Progression tracking
- Standards alignment verification
