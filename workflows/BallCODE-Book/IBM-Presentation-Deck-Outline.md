# IBM Presentation Deck - Slide-by-Slide Outline

**Purpose:** Saturday Teaser Presentation  
**Slides:** 9 slides (10-15 minute presentation)  
**Content Source:** IBM-One-Pager-Executive-Summary.md

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** BallCODE  
**Subtitle:** Learn how robots think—through the game you love.

**Visual:**
- BallCODE logo (if available)
- Basketball + code elements
- Clean, modern design

**Content:**
- Your name
- Date
- "Partnership Opportunity"

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**Title:** The Challenge: Low STEM Engagement

**Content:**
- 50+ million students in target age range (grades 3-8)
- Traditional coding education struggles with engagement
- Underrepresented groups particularly affected
- Gap between student interests and STEM education

**Visual:**
- Statistics or data visualization
- Or: Simple graphic showing the gap

**Key Point:** "Kids love basketball. They don't always love coding. What if we could bridge that gap?"

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

**Title:** BallCODE: Sports-to-Code Learning Pathway

**Content:**
- First-of-its-kind curriculum that bridges sports and coding
- Uses basketball context students already understand
- Progressive pathway: Sports Language → Code Bridge → Python
- 70% story, 30% instruction (engagement-focused)

**Visual:**
- Diagram showing the 3-phase pathway
- Or: Basketball + code fusion graphic

**Key Point:** "We use what kids already know (basketball) to teach what they need to learn (coding)"

---

## Slide 4: How It Works

**Title:** Three-Phase Learning Pathway

**Content:**

**Phase 1: Sports Language (Block Coding)**
- Students learn using basketball terminology
- Visual block interface (no typing required)
- Immediate feedback through game integration

**Phase 2: Transition Bridge**
- See how sports language maps to code
- Blocks and code side-by-side
- Understanding that blocks = code

**Phase 3: Python Learning**
- Progress to Python syntax
- Same concepts, different representation
- Real-world programming skills

**Visual:**
- Three-column layout showing each phase
- Or: Progressive diagram

**Key Point:** "We start where students are (basketball) and take them where they need to go (Python)"

---

## Slide 5: Episode 1 Preview

**Title:** Episode 1: The Tip-off Trial

**Content:**
- **Learning Focus:** State Management
- **Basketball Context:** Managing possession state from tip-off
- **Coding Concept:** Variables, state transitions, if/then logic
- **Story:** Engaging narrative with characters facing challenges

**Visual:**
- Court Map visual (if generated)
- Or: State Diagram visual
- Or: Story scene illustration

**Demo Opportunity:**
- Show Episode 1 website page
- Or: Show story excerpt
- Or: Show QR code (scan it live)

**Key Point:** "This is what it looks like - story, concept, practice, all integrated"

---

## Slide 6: 12-Episode Curriculum
