- [ ] **Logic**: How this builds on previous books, systematic progression planned
- [ ] **Examples**: Previous successful stories reviewed, case studies consulted
- [ ] **Adaptation**: Constraints identified, flexibility needs assessed
- [ ] **Results**: Success metrics defined, measurement points identified

**For detailed CLEAR:** See `AIMCODE-METHODOLOGY.md` Phase 1

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Choose Which Book to Write
- [ ] **Book 1:** Dribble Level 1 (Pound Dribble) - Foundation Blocks
