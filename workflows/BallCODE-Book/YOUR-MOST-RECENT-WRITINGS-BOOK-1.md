## ACT I: THE PRESS

### Scene 1: Opening - The Chaos Begins

I have the ball for the first time in the first game I have ever played for any school. This was the moment where my senses came back, and I smelled the fresh popcorn, and all the crowd noise went silent. All I could hear was my breathing, teammates screaming out commands, the coach telling us what to do. Everything else faded away, just the ball and my teammates and the opponent. I was completely in the moment.

They are full court pressing. My hands are sweating, the ball is slippery, and my heart is pounding. I am trapped immediately. The defenders were coming around me block by block with a stiff walk like the scarecrow in Wizard of Oz. They would come in closing in the angles, and closing in fast, and they are so big and strong there is nowhere to go.

I feel nerves that I do not want to mess up, things are moving so fast, and all I hear is noise. It is like being at a heavy metal concert because the students are jumping up and down. The court was closed up. I couldn't see the angles. The blocks were not there. I was unable to see a path forward. I have my coach in my head saying, "I believe in you Ava!" As soon as I thought this, the game began to slow down, and it was like I was awakened as my confidence came back fully.

I see and feel that if I simplify the game and limit my move to 1-3 dribbles I will be more effective. I get the ball and go 1 block with a pound(), another block, pound(), and then shot with precision. I gave them no time to think to trap me or I would get a screen to get the wall off me to get to my shot. I was moving with ultimate purpose, and it slowly started working.

I wanted to dribble but there was no room because everyone was huge and there were no angles. I threw the ball and turned it over. I was distraught in the moment, feeling like I was letting the team down as my stomach dropped. My Coach told me, "Trust your training and don't get frustrated." But how? Everything was going wrong.

There was no way to know how they were going to play us, but they were playing an aggressive press, and they were playing on the top side of all of our players. This made it difficult because all of our offensives started with a pass to the wing. We should have practiced a back door cut or something for these situations. It seemed like they had 7 players to our 5 with how they were everywhere on the press and then they made sure that our offense could not function. Think about when you are playing dodgeball and your team is at the disadvantage, that is how it felt.

This is when I thought about WatsonX, but I didn't act on using AI then. The game was moving at a pace that was faster than mice as we could not think but just see and react. No time to process. No time to plan. Just survive.

### Scene 2: Failed Attempts

I go to do my moves and get into my bag. I did my between the legs crossover over and over, and then behind the back wrap, but to no avail as the defense read every move. I was not going to give up even though I felt like I tried everything and my mind started to have doubts that maybe they are just better. Just think I am playing "And 1" style streetball, I am doing move after move trying to get by this elite defender but they are like the wall of China. That was actually someone on my team's nickname so these robots can play. There is no solution as we continue to turn it over and were missing a lot of shots. They begin to pull away with their pressing style of play and celebrating in their robot voices, "Nice shot!" Each celebration stung. But I wouldn't quit.

## ACT II: THE FOUNDATION

### Scene 4: The Math Connection

I come off the screen. Atlas cuts hard and catches, then sees me opening up right on time to hit me for the score. With the mindset of just getting to a spot, I do that with a quick dribble if needed, and if not, I shoot. WatsonX gives me the understanding of the efficiency of what I am doing now and how I am being much more effective with my +/- (see glossary). WatsonX's voice says, "Plus 10 this half. Your fundamental approach is really working for the team." I smiled. The simple approach was working.

### Scene 5: The Coding Connection

I get a block from WatsonX. A square appears on the court that glows, the open spot. So when they start taking away the catch and shot, they press up closely, forcing me to put the ball on the floor, I start to take that one dribble into the block each time for a pull-up jump shot now. Swish. Again and again. The blocks were working.

### Scene 6: The Struggle and Acceptance

I keep wanting to do more but the Coach and WatsonX tell me to stick with the process. Part of me wants to do a cross, spin, in&Out, but I remain disciplined. The flashy moves called to me. But I stayed focused. Foundation first. WatsonX yells out, "If shot, else block by block, print results," in a voice only he has.

## ACT III: BREAKING THROUGH

### Scene 1: Final Challenge

Down by 2 with 30 seconds left. I am completely in the moment. I feel my instincts taking over. Everyone on my team is playing in sync, and the commands are given to me even within the press break passing and cutting, and only using the pound dribble in the blocks where I absolutely need it. If not I just keep moving without the ball. We were one. Moving together. Thinking together.

### Scene 2: Application - Using the Sequence

They are reading me to get to this shot, I have to adjust. I saw that they now see what I am doing, so now I add in an additional dribble into my sequence going from pound() to pound(), pound(), pound(), pound() dribble. They couldn't predict that as this is the first time I used 4 and I tied the game and 1. The crowd erupted. My teammates cheered. I'd made it happen. The foundation blocks were working like magic.

### Scene 3: Success - Breaking the Press

I banked it in. Each make was making me gain more confidence in myself. I am finally able to break the press, and within the offense get my shot off, and strategically decide what is the best move hitting shots and helping my team advance the ball time after time. I get past half court again and again finding my teammates assisting, or making a play for myself. I found my flow! Everything clicked for us. The game slowed down. I could see 20/20. This was what it felt like to be in the zone.

### Scene 4: Reflection - The Connection

As the final buzzer sounded, I understood that in life and in basketball: Sometimes you just have to stick to the fundamentals that you learned first.

When someone is really good on defense, you have to strategically use your teammates and WatsonX to strategize how to get through the defense to win. When the defender locked me down, I passed to Sniper. If that wasn't open, I would find a lane to cut, or listen to WatsonX on where to go for an open block. Teamwork. Data. Strategy.

That is the power of data and analytics along with feel. I felt something, told the AI about it, and it helped me understand what was going on.

Early in the game I forced shots and was inefficient in my movement. WatsonX showed me how to look at the percentages and the angles of the trapping press to be efficient and effective. The data guided my decision making and I still used my feel to create flow.

### Scene 5: Future - What's Next

My Coach and our team were pleased with my performance and the win no matter how I played! High fives all around. My teammates were smiling and telling me how well I played. I gave them the credit, as they kept believing in me even when I was making mistakes. Coach Circuit smiled. "Fundamentals first, Ava, and build off of that. Always." The win felt good, but the lesson felt better.
