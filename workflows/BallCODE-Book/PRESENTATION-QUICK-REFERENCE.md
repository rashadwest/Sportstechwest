## 💬 KEY TALKING POINTS

### Opening (30 sec)
> "Thank you for your time. I'm here to show you BallCODE—a platform that's already working. Book 1 is complete, live, and generating sales. This isn't a concept—it's a proven foundation ready to scale."

### Core Message
> "We've built a proven foundation with Book 1 complete and live. We have a systematic approach to content creation, a complete curriculum framework, and technical architecture ready for scale. What you see is a working product. What we're building is a scalable platform."

### Closing
> "We have a proven foundation, a complete curriculum framework, and a scalable platform. We're ready to scale. The question is: How can we partner to accelerate this?"
