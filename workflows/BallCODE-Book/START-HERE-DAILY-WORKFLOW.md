## 🔄 How the System Works

**When you start a new chat session:**
1. AI checks `DATE-TIME-TRACKER.md` for current date
2. AI checks `ADD-TRACKER.md` and `OVERALL-GOAL-TRACKING.md` for today's ONE thing
3. AI displays the ONE thing prominently at chat start (MANDATORY)
4. AI finds yesterday's `DAILY-WORKFLOW-[DATE].md` file
5. AI pulls the "COMPLETE PREVIOUS DAY REVIEW" section
6. AI pre-fills question 0.5 with yesterday's completion info
7. You review and confirm, then proceed with today's work
8. AI tracks all actions against the ONE thing and logs deviations if you switch tasks before completion
