- ⚠️ **MISSING:** Live site verification
- ⚠️ **MISSING:** Content hash verification

**Issues Identified:**
1. **No Netlify Verification** - We push to GitHub but don't verify Netlify picks it up
2. **No Live Site Verification** - We don't verify changes are actually on ballcode.co
3. **No Deployment Status Check** - We don't know if builds succeed

**Impact:** HIGH - We think deployment works, but we don't verify it actually reaches the live site.

**Solution Needed:**
- Add Netlify API verification to deployment script
- Add live site verification (curl, content hash, image checks)
- Verify latest changes are live
