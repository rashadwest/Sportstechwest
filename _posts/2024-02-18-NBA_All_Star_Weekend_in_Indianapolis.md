## A Memorable Weekend with Sports Executives
NBA All-Star weekend in [Indianapolis](https://visitindy.com/) was packed with unforgettable moments. I had the chance to attend exclusive events with **sports executives**, surrounded by people as passionate about the game as I am. It was an amazing weekend spent with my guys, **[DT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derrickthomas32)** and **[Chad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chad-easterling-a5419722)**, who made each moment even better. Indianapolis turned out to be the ideal spot for a memorable experience—but it had its challenges too. 

## The Challenge of Charging an Electric Car in Indianapolis
One night, I couldn’t find a charging station for my [electric rental car](https://www.rentalcars.com/en/electric-car/), so I had to stay up all night to keep it from going dead until the rental car place opened the next morning. It was a minor setback in an otherwise fantastic weekend, but it taught me a valuable lesson in preparedness when traveling with an electric vehicle.

## Exclusive Events and Networking Opportunities
Beyond that unexpected adventure, the weekend was filled with some of the best events and networking experiences. I made it to a [Hennessy](https://www.hennessy.com/us/) party, the [NBPA (National Basketball Players Association)](https://nbpa.com/) party, the **NBA Dunk Contest** and **3-Point Contest** afterparty, and an event hosted by [Baron Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Davis) that felt like an all-in-one conference. Each of these gatherings brought together influential voices in the sports world, offering invaluable insights and opportunities to reconnect with friends from past events.

## Reuniting with Friends at the NBPA Event
One of the best moments was attending an [NBPA](https://nbpa.com/) event, where I ran into a lot of familiar faces and got to catch up with friends. Being in a room full of people who share a love for sports and understand the business side of it made the night even more impactful.

## Reflecting on the Connections and Memories Made
All in all, Indianapolis brought together a mix of professional and social experiences that left me with plenty of new connections and memories to carry forward. This weekend wasn’t just about the NBA All-Star events; it was about building relationships that would last far beyond the game.
