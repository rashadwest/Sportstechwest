## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS MANUAL ACTION TOMORROW

### 🔴 CRITICAL: Build Failure Investigation (30-60 minutes)

**Status:** Builds are failing - need to investigate  
**Priority:** HIGH - Blocks all game integration

**Steps:**
1. **Check Build Logs** (10 min)
   - Go to: https://github.com/rashadwest/BTEBallCODE/actions
   - Click latest failed run
   - Identify exact error message
   - Screenshot or copy error details

2. **Common Issues to Check:**
   - BuildScript.cs missing or incorrect path
   - Unity license configuration
   - Build settings/scene paths
   - Unity version mismatch

3. **Fix and Re-trigger** (20-40 min)
   - Apply fix based on error
   - Re-trigger build
   - Monitor until success

**Expected Result:** ✅ Successful WebGL build deployed to Netlify

---

### 🟡 HIGH: Phase 1 - Netlify Setup (15-20 minutes)

**Status:** May need verification or completion  
**Priority:** HIGH - Required for automation

### 🟡 MEDIUM: Exercise Return Flow Implementation (1-2 hours)

**Status:** Architecture done, code implementation pending  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Completes learning loop

**What Needs to Be Done:**
1. **Unity JavaScript Bridge** (30 min)
   - Update `Builds/WebGL/index.html` (if building locally)
   - Add return URL function
   - Test locally

2. **Unity Return Code** (30 min)
   - Add return call on exercise completion
