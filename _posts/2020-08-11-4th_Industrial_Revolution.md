# 4th Industrial Revolution

## The culture of data and analytics

![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/blog-img/4th-industrial-revolution-graphics.webp?=raw)

The talent coming into the analytics business is impressive.  I think in sports there should be two different types of people. The person who knows the game of basketball and then a math or data expert. 
I think it would be great if these two individuals work together.  

Data and analytics will take over every part of the business of sports.  My favorite part is performance.  This part of the industry is where I will focus all of my time and focus.  

The products I put out will be for training and education.
