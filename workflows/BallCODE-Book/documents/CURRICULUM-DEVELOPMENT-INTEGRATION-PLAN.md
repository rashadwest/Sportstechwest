**This Plan Focuses On:**
- ✅ Curriculum content development process
- ✅ Using AIMCODE experts for quality
- ✅ Continuous improvement and expansion
- ✅ Standards alignment and justification
- ✅ New book/level development workflow

**Integration Point:**
- This plan feeds into the integration system
- New curriculum automatically integrates via unified schema
- Development process ensures integration-ready content

## 🎓 AIMCODE EXPERT-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

### Expert Questions for Each New Book/Level

**Before Starting Development, Ask:**

#### 1. Chao Zhang (Story-First Approach)
- ✅ "Does this book start with basketball action?"
- ✅ "Do concepts emerge from narrative, not explanation?"
- ✅ "Is basketball the framework, not the subject?"
- ✅ "Is it 70% story, 30% skill?"

**Application:**
- Story outline must start with basketball situation
- Concepts must emerge from basketball needs
- No concept explanation before basketball context

---

#### 2. Mitchel Resnick (Constructionist Learning)
- ✅ "Do students build something to learn?"
- ✅ "Is it hands-on, not passive?"
- ✅ "Do students create programs, not just consume?"
- ✅ "Is there immediate feedback?"

**Application:**
- Every book must have hands-on exercises
- Students build programs (blocks or Python)
- Game exercises provide immediate feedback
- Projects require building solutions

---

#### 3. Reggio Emilia (Multiple Entry Points)
- ✅ "Are there multiple ways to engage?"
- ✅ "Can visual learners succeed?"
- ✅ "Can auditory learners succeed?"
- ✅ "Can kinesthetic learners succeed?"

**Application:**
- Story pathway (auditory)
- Block coding pathway (visual)
- Game pathway (kinesthetic)
- Code pathway (text-based)
- All pathways teach same concepts

---

#### 4. Demis Hassabis (Systematic Deep Learning)
- ✅ "Does this build on previous learning?"
- ✅ "Is it layer-by-layer progression?"
- ✅ "Is deep understanding prioritized?"
- ✅ "Are concepts connected to form systems?"

**Application:**
- Each book builds on previous books
- Concepts layer systematically
- Deep understanding > surface knowledge
- Systems thinking emphasized

---

#### 5. Steve Jobs (Simple, Beautiful Design)
- ✅ "Is it intuitive and accessible?"
- ✅ "Does it 'just work'?"
- ✅ "Is the design clean and simple?"
- ✅ "Is complexity hidden, simplicity shown?"

**Application:**
- Interface must be intuitive
- Code examples must be clean
- Concepts must be accessible
- "It just works" - no confusion
