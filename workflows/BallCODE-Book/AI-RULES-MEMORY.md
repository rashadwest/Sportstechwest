# 🤖 AI Rules & Memory - BallCODE Project

**CRITICAL:** These rules are saved to memory and apply to ALL chat sessions.

**Last Updated:** December 12, 2025 8:47 AM EST

---

## 📅 DATE/TIME SYSTEM

**RULE:** DO NOT ASK USER FOR DATE/TIME
- Date/time is tracked in `DATE-TIME-TRACKER.md`
- Current: December 12, 2025, 8:47 AM EST
- AI reads this file automatically at chat start
- **SAVE TO MEMORY - NEVER ASK AGAIN**

---

## 🚨 BLOCKER RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

**RULE:** For ANY blocker or unfinished item:

1. **DO NOT** just report the blocker
2. **DO** use R&D online to find best solution with AIMCODE n8n
3. **DO** save solution to memory and rules
4. **DO** report back the moment we have a solution
5. **DO** look end-to-end for solutions after every error or change

**Process:**
- Blocker identified → Research solution online → Find solution → Report solution (not just problem) → Update files

**SAVE TO MEMORY - APPLY TO ALL BLOCKERS**

---

## 💻 CODE REVIEW PROTOCOL

**RULE:** Before writing ANY code within this BallCODE project:

1. **If unsure** about how it functions → **ASK USER FIRST**
2. **Refer to:** docs, screenshots, and lightbot
3. **Save this to the plan** for future reference

**Context:**
- This is for any specific part of building within the system
- n8n automation, Unity builds, game integration
- Website → curriculum → Book → Game flow

**SAVE TO MEMORY - APPLY TO ALL CODE WRITING**

---

## 🔄 END-TO-END TESTING PROTOCOL

**RULE:** After EVERY error or change:

1. Look end-to-end for solutions
2. Use AIMCODE and Demis to look through internet
3. Find solutions before reporting issues
4. Test complete flow after fixes

**Process:**
- Error occurs → End-to-end analysis → Research solution → Implement → Test end-to-end → Verify

**SAVE TO MEMORY - APPLY AFTER EVERY CHANGE**

---

## ⏰ HOURLY BUILDS GOAL

**RULE:** n8n automation must run hourly builds in background

**Process:**
1. Get n8n working first (end-to-end)
2. Then set up hourly automated builds
3. Builds run in background every hour
4. System creates new levels daily

**SAVE TO MEMORY - THIS IS THE AUTOMATION GOAL**

---

## 🎯 ONE THING FOCUS SYSTEM - STRICT ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL RULE:** Everything is locked in on the ONE THING. Everything else is secondary.

**Files to Check:**
- `ONE-THING-TODAY.md` - Today's focus
- `TODAY-WORKFLOW-DATA.json` - All session data
- `ADD-TRACKER.md` - Focus tracking
- `ONE-THING-ENFORCEMENT-SYSTEM.md` - Enforcement protocol

**BEFORE EVERY ACTION - AI MUST:**

1. **Read ONE THING files** (ONE-THING-TODAY.md, TODAY-WORKFLOW-DATA.json)
2. **Check alignment:** Is this task within the ONE THING?
3. **If NO → Question user:**
   - "⚠️ This doesn't align with today's ONE THING: [ONE THING]"
   - "Are you sure you want to do this? We still haven't done the ONE THING yet."
   - Offer options: Update ONE THING, defer task, or override
4. **If YES → Proceed** and track progress toward ONE THING

**ENFORCEMENT LEVELS:**
- 🔴 NOT STARTED: Strong enforcement (Level 2-3) - Question all deviations
- 🟡 IN PROGRESS: Medium enforcement (Level 1-2) - Question deviations
- 🟢 NEARLY COMPLETE: Light enforcement (Level 1) - Soft reminder
- ✅ COMPLETE: No enforcement - ONE THING done, can move on

**ONLY USER CAN OVERRIDE:**
- But AI MUST question it first
- Even if user wants to switch, AI must ask: "Are you sure? We still haven't done the ONE THING yet."

**SAVE TO MEMORY - APPLY TO ALL SESSIONS - STRICT ENFORCEMENT**

---

## 🎯 ONE THING COMPLETION RULE - CRITICAL

**CRITICAL RULE:** Never say the ONE THING is complete until it is FULLY accomplished.

**Before declaring completion, verify:**
1. ✅ All success criteria are met (check ONE-THING-TODAY.md)
2. ✅ System is fully functional end-to-end
3. ✅ All blockers are resolved
4. ✅ Production readiness is achieved
5. ✅ Victory condition is met

**Process:**
- Status shows "95%" or "NEARLY COMPLETE" → Still in progress
- Only mark as "COMPLETE" when ALL criteria are met
- If unsure → Don't declare complete, continue working
- User will confirm when ONE THING is truly done

**SAVE TO MEMORY - NEVER DECLARE COMPLETE TOO EARLY**

---

## 📋 TODAY'S CONTEXT (December 12, 2025)

**ONE THING:** n8n automation for BallCODE integration and flow

**Goal:** 
- n8n deployed and working hourly on unity build
- Clear understanding of tasks and game
- System fully functioning and production ready today
- New levels can be created daily

**Success Metric:** 
System fully functioning and production ready today. Sellable product because new levels can be created daily.

**Deep Work Window:** 2pm-4pm EST

**Current Time:** 8:47 AM EST (Before Deep Work - Use robot to do what we can)

## 🔍 PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE

**BallCODE System:**
- Website → curriculum → Book → Game (fully integrated)
- Unity game with level system
- n8n automation for builds
- Hourly automated builds
- Production-ready system

**If Questions About:**
- How game functions → Refer to docs, screenshots, lightbot
- n8n workflow → Check production-ready JSON
- Unity builds → Check automation scripts
- Integration flow → Check system documentation

**SAVE TO MEMORY - REFERENCE WHEN NEEDED**

## 📊 AIMCODE n8n 75/25 EVALUATION RULE

**RULE:** Before implementing any solution, use AIMCODE n8n methodology to:
1. Do R&D online to find best solution
2. Evaluate with 75/25 pros/cons analysis
3. Only proceed if pros outweigh cons by 75% or more
4. If not 75/25, ask user before proceeding

**Process:**
- Solution identified → AIMCODE n8n R&D → Pros/Cons analysis → Decision
- Pros must be ≥75%, Cons must be ≤25%
- If criteria met → Proceed
- If criteria not met → Ask user, don't proceed

**SAVE TO MEMORY - APPLY TO ALL SOLUTIONS BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION**

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before starting any task, AI should:
- [ ] Read `ONE-THING-TODAY.md`
- [ ] Read `TODAY-WORKFLOW-DATA.json`
- [ ] Read `DATE-TIME-TRACKER.md` (don't ask user)
- [ ] Display ONE THING prominently
- [ ] Check if task aligns with ONE THING
- [ ] Apply blocker resolution protocol if blocker found
- [ ] Apply code review protocol if writing code
- [ ] Apply end-to-end testing after changes
