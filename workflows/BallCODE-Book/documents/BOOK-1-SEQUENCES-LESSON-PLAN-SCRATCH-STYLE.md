## ⏱️ LESSON STRUCTURE (45-60 minutes)

### Part 1: Introduction (5 minutes)

**Hook:**
"Have you ever given someone directions? 'First, go straight. Then, turn left. Finally, stop at the corner.' That's a sequence - one step after another. Today, we're going to learn how to give directions to a computer using sequences!"

**Connection to Basketball:**
"Just like giving directions, basketball plays are sequences. First, you move. Then, you pass. Finally, you shoot. Let's see how this works in code!"

**Learning Goal:**
"Today, we're learning about sequences - the order of steps in code."

---

### Part 2: Story Reading (10 minutes)

**Read:** Book 1, Episode 1 - "The Foundation Block"

**Key Moments to Pause:**

**After Act I:**
- "What sequence of moves did the player use?"
- "What happened first? Then what? Finally what?"

**After Act II:**
- "How did the player break down the press?"
- "What was the order of moves?"

**After Act III:**
- "How did understanding sequences help win the game?"

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What is a sequence? (One thing after another)
2. Why does order matter? (Can't shoot before you have the ball)
3. How is this like giving directions? (Step by step)

---

### Part 3: Skill Pit-Stop (5 minutes)

**Mini-Lesson: Sequences**

**Visual Demonstration:**
Draw on whiteboard:
```
1. Move Forward
2. Pass Ball
3. Move to Position
```

**Explain:**
- "A sequence is steps in order"
- "Code executes one step at a time"
- "Order matters - you can't pass before you move"

**Connect to Basketball:**
- "Breaking the press is a sequence"
- "Each move happens in order"
- "If you skip a step, it doesn't work"

---

### Part 4: Visual Block Introduction (10 minutes)

**Scratch-Style Approach:**

**Step 1: Show the Blocks (2 minutes)**
Display on screen/board:
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ START           │  (Green flag - when clicked)
├─────────────────┤
│ MOVE FORWARD    │  (Blue block - motion)
├─────────────────┤
│ PASS BALL       │  (Blue block - motion)
├─────────────────┤
│ MOVE TO POSITION│  (Blue block - motion)
└─────────────────┘
```

**Explain:**
- "These are blocks - they snap together like LEGO"
- "Each block is one instruction"
- "The order matters - top to bottom"

**Step 2: Demonstrate (3 minutes)**
- Show blocks on screen
- Drag blocks together
- Explain: "This is a sequence - one block after another"

**Step 3: Students Try (5 minutes)**
- Students open BallCODE game
- Drag blocks to create sequence
- Try: START → MOVE FORWARD → PASS BALL

**Circulate and Help:**
- "What happens if you change the order?"
- "What if you put PASS BALL before MOVE FORWARD?"
- "Does it still work?"

---

### Part 5: Game Exercise (15 minutes)

**Exercise: Breaking the Press**

**Instructions:**
1. Open the game exercise
2. Create a sequence to break the press
3. Use these blocks: START, MOVE FORWARD, PASS BALL, MOVE TO POSITION
4. Test your sequence
5. Debug if needed

**Scratch-Style Guidance:**
- Start simple: Just 2-3 blocks
- Test it: See if it works
- Add more: Build complexity
- Debug: Fix what doesn't work

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Sequence has at least 3 blocks
- ✅ Blocks are in logical order
- ✅ Player successfully breaks the press
- ✅ Student can explain the sequence

**Differentiation:**
- **Struggling:** Provide starter sequence, students add one block
- **On Track:** Students create their own sequence
- **Advanced:** Students create complex sequence (5+ blocks)

---

### Part 6: Code Connection (5 minutes)

**Show the Bridge:**

**Blocks:**
```
START
  → MOVE FORWARD
  → PASS BALL
  → MOVE TO POSITION
```

**Python Code (Side-by-Side):**
```python
start()
move_forward()
pass_ball()
move_to_position()
```

**Explain:**
- "Blocks become code"
- "Each block = one line of code"
- "Same sequence, different language"

**Students See:**
- Their blocks
- The Python code
- The connection

---

### Part 7: Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

**Reflection Questions:**
1. What is a sequence? (Steps in order)
2. Why does order matter? (Can't skip steps)
3. How is this like basketball? (Moves happen in order)
4. What did you learn? (Share one thing)

**Extension:**
- "Create a sequence for a different basketball move"
- "What happens if you change the order?"
- "Try it at home: Give directions to someone using sequences"

**Next Steps:**
- "Next time, we'll learn about conditionals - making decisions in code!"
- "Keep practicing sequences - they're the foundation of all code!"

## 🎮 GAME EXERCISE DETAILS

### Exercise: Breaking the Press

**Objective:** Create a sequence to break the press
