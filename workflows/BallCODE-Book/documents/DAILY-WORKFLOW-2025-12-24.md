## 🎯 TODAY'S ONE THING

**From ADD Tracker:**

CRITICAL PRIORITY: Development of the Game
- Research and fix game development issues using AIMCODE methodology
- Identify root causes of build/deployment failures
- Apply expert solutions and peer-reviewed research
```

**Status:** 🟢 Complete (100%)

**Why This Matters:**
- Full Integration currently generates plans but doesn't execute them
- System doesn't actually work - just generates JSON
- Blocks everything else - must be done first
- Makes Full Integration truly autonomous and functional

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Task #1: Python Script Execution Complete (90% → 100%) ✅
  - [x] Test script execution end-to-end ✅
  - [x] All 4 wrapper scripts tested and working ✅
- [x] Task #2: Deployment Automation Complete (50% → 100%) ✅
  - [x] After website updates: Execute `garvis-deploy.py --website` ✅
  - [x] After game updates: Trigger Unity Build Orchestrator webhook ✅
  - [x] After curriculum updates: Execute `update_ballcode_schema.py` ✅ (already implemented)
  - [x] Verify deployments succeeded ✅
- [x] Task #3: Error Handling Complete (0% → 100%) ✅
  - [x] Wrap all script executions in try/catch ✅
  - [x] Error reporting in JSON output ✅
  - [x] Partial success allowed (errors don't stop workflow) ✅
  - [x] Detailed error messages in results ✅
