## 🎯 TODAY'S ONE DOMINO

**What is the ONE task today that makes everything else easier or unnecessary?**
```
Task: Finish BallCODE full integration end-to-end and produce proof links (build artifact + deployed URL + verification output)
```

**Why this domino?** (How does completing this make everything else easier?)

```
- Converts “specs + parts” into a working system you can trust
- Creates a repeatable baseline (rerun steps + known-good config)
- Unblocks everything downstream because the integration path is verified
- Makes future fixes cheaper: one verified baseline to compare against
```

**What happens if I DON'T complete this today?**

```
- Integration stays “almost done” and keeps draining time via rework/context switching
- No reliable demo/deploy path for partners or schools
- Every downstream task stays risky because the foundation is unverified
```

**What happens if I DO complete this today?**

```
- You have a clean green run (end-to-end) you can repeat
- You can demo/share confidently (deployed URL + verification record)
- Next steps become obvious and measurable (remaining gaps are isolated)
```

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**How will I know this is complete?**

- [ ] One end-to-end run completes without manual intervention
- [ ] Build output is generated and linkable (artifact or hosted output)
- [ ] Deployed URL loads successfully (basic smoke test passes)
- [ ] Verification output is saved (logs / checklist / report)
- [ ] A short runbook exists (how to rerun + where to look when it fails)

**What does "done" look like?**

```
A working integration baseline with:
- A deployed URL you can open right now
- A saved verification record (what ran, when, what passed)
- A repeatable “rerun in 10 minutes” checklist (runbook)
```

---

## ⏱️ TIME & ENERGY

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours total
- Deep Work: 2-3 hours (end-to-end run + fix primary blocker)
- Wrap-up: 30-60 minutes (verification record + runbook)

**Energy Required:** 
- [ ] Low (1-3) - Can do when tired
- [X] Medium (4-6) - Need moderate focus
- [ ] High (7-10) - Need peak energy (do in Deep Work window)

**Best Time to Do This:**
- [ ] Morning (high energy)
- [X] Morning (high energy) - **Your Deep Work: 9:30am–12:00pm**
- [ ] Evening (low energy tasks only)

## 🚨 PRE-WORK CHECKLIST (Complete Before Starting)

### 1️⃣ Orchestrate — Don't Multitask
- [ ] **What ONE system/process am I focusing on today?**
  - Answer: Finishing BallCODE full integration (end-to-end run + proof)
- [ ] **What is the ownership structure?** (Who owns what?)
  - Answer: I set priorities + make final calls; AI handles checklists, log triage, and runbook drafting
- [ ] **What automation is in place?**
  - Answer: Existing workflows/scripts + repeatable verification checklist
- [ ] **What accountability exists?**
  - Answer: Success metrics defined, escalation triggers set

### 2️⃣ Protect Deep Work Windows
- [ ] **When is my Deep Work window today?**
  - Start: **9:30am** End: **12:00pm**
- [ ] **Have I blocked this time?** (Calendar, notifications off, etc.)
  - Answer: DND on + calendar block + single workspace only
- [ ] **What distractions will I eliminate?**
  - [ ] Phone on silent/Do Not Disturb
  - [ ] Email closed
  - [ ] Slack/Teams notifications off
  - [ ] Browser tabs limited to work essentials
  - [ ] Door closed/headphones on
- [ ] **What strategy work will happen in this window?**
  - Answer: One clean end-to-end integration run + fix the primary blocker (only)

### 3️⃣ Batch Similar Contexts
- [ ] **What context blocks have I planned today?**
  - [ ] Finance Block: None today
  - [ ] Creative/Marketing Block: None until integration is green
  - [X] Technical/Development Block: **9:30am–12:00pm** (integration run + fixes)
  - [ ] Communication Block: **12:15pm–12:45pm** (batch updates/messages)
  - [ ] Review/Planning Block: **End of day** (15 minutes)
- [ ] **How many context switches am I planning?** (Target: ≤3)
  - Answer: **2-3** (Run → Fix → Verify/Document)

### 4️⃣ Delegate with Context
- [ ] **What am I delegating today?** (To AI)

  **Task 1: End-to-End Verification Checklist**
    - Goal: Produce a runnable “green run” checklist for BallCODE full integration
    - Success Metric: Checklist ends with proof links + expected outputs, no ambiguity
    - Escalation Trigger: If steps depend on unknown secrets/credentials or missing prerequisites → escalate

  **Task 2: Log Triage + Root-Cause Summary**
    - Goal: If a run fails, summarize the single primary blocker + the smallest fix
    - Success Metric: Symptom → cause → fix → verification step (1 page)
    - Escalation Trigger: If failure repeats after one fix attempt or touches credentials/infra → escalate

  **Task 3: Runbook Drafting**
    - Goal: Create a short “how to rerun / how to debug” runbook
    - Success Metric: Someone can rerun in 10 minutes with zero tribal knowledge
    - Escalation Trigger: If runbook can’t be written due to unclear steps → escalate

### 5️⃣ Use If–Then Rules
- [ ] **What automated behaviors am I using today?**
  - [X] If it's 9:30am → then I enter Deep Work
  - [X] If AI confidence < 80% → then I review
  - [ ] If task takes < 2 min → then I do it now
  - [ ] If task takes > 2 hours → then I break it down
  - [X] If a failure blocks > 15 minutes → then capture logs and reduce to one smallest fix
  - [X] If I catch myself starting a second system → then park it and return to the run

### 6️⃣ Track Your Metrics Daily
- [ ] **Focus Time Target:** 2.5 hours (9:30am–12:00pm)
- [ ] **Delegations Created Target:** 3 (checklist, triage, runbook)
- [ ] **Context Switches Target:** ≤ 3

### 7️⃣ Automate for Clarity, Not Complexity
- [ ] **What repetitive/reactive work am I automating?**
  - Answer: Verification checklist, log capture/triage, and repeatable rerun steps
- [ ] **What am I reserving my time for?** (Creative direction, relationships, judgment)
  - Answer: Prioritization, decision-making, and acceptance of “green run” proof

### 8️⃣ Move One Domino a Day
- [ ] **What is the ONE task today that makes everything else easier or unnecessary?**
  - Answer: Finish BallCODE full integration end-to-end with proof links + verification record
- [ ] **Why is this the domino?** (How does it compound?)
  - Answer: Establishes a trusted baseline so everything downstream becomes faster and safer
- [ ] **When will I complete it?**
  - Time: **By end of day (target: 2-4 hours)**

### 9️⃣ Audit Systems Weekly
- [ ] **Is today an audit day?** (Weekly: Sunday)
  - [X] YES → Review automation and delegations
  - [ ] NO → Skip to next section

### 🔟 Protect Energy Like a KPI
- [ ] **What is my energy level right now?** (1-10)
  - Answer: 7 / 10
- [ ] **What rest/reset do I need?**
  - [ ] Sleep quality last night: _______________
  - [ ] Exercise planned: _______________
  - [ ] Meal timing planned: _______________

## 📋 STORY QUALITY CHECKLIST

**Content Must Be:**
- [ ] Rigorous enough for advanced students (Triangle Science & Math, NC Science & Math)
- [ ] Clearly explains AI/math/coding concepts
- [ ] Engaging enough to hold attention
- [ ] Educational value evident
- [ ] Professional presentation

**Story Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Starts with basketball action (not concept explanation)
- [ ] Basketball terminology used naturally
- [ ] AI/math/coding concepts emerge FROM basketball needs
- [ ] 3-act structure followed
- [ ] Basketball success demonstrates mastery
- [ ] Engaging and adventurous (70% story, 30% skill)
- [ ] Word count: 1,200-1,800 words per book

---

## 💡 IS THIS THE BEST USE OF YOUR TIME?

### Assessment:

**✅ YES - This is the right focus because:**

1. **Revenue Generation:** Creates sellable product immediately
2. **Target Audience Ready:** Content for Triangle Science & Math, NC Science & Math contacts
3. **Production Workflow:** Establishes process for remaining 4 books
4. **Execution Gap:** Addresses the 0% website implementation
5. **Tuesday Deadline:** Gets content ready for value presentation by Tuesday

**⚠️ Considerations:**
- **Visual Assets:** Still at 0% - but not needed for video recordings
- **Game Integration:** Still at 30% - but books can be standalone initially
- **Outreach:** Still at 0% - but books are needed before outreach

**Recommendation:** **YES, proceed with books.** This creates immediate value and unblocks revenue. Visual assets and game integration can happen in parallel or after books are complete.
