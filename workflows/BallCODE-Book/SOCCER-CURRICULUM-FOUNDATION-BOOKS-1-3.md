## 📚 BOOK 2: "THE CODE OF FLOW"

### Expert Alignment

#### Zhang (Story-First):

## 📚 BOOK 3: "THE PATTERN"

### Expert Alignment

#### Zhang (Story-First):
**Story Opening:**
"Three defenders formed a wall. 'Pattern time,' Coach called. 'Repeat the sequence: In, Out, Cut. That's a loop!' Maya realized. The same sequence, repeated, could break through any defense."

**✅ Starts with tactical challenge**
**✅ Loops emerge from pattern need**
**✅ Real-world application**

#### Resnick (Constructionist):
**Building Activities:**
1. **Block Coding:** Loop SKILL 1 → SKILL 2 → SKILL 3
   ```
   START
     → REPEAT 3 TIMES:
       → SKILL 1 (Basic Dribble)
       → SKILL 2 (Cut Dribble)
       → SKILL 3 (In & Out)
     → GOAL
   ```

2. **Game Exercise:** Repeating pattern
