# ✅ AI Pre-Action Checklist

**CRITICAL:** Use this BEFORE every action, task, or decision.

---

## 🔍 STEP 1: Read ONE THING Files

- [ ] Read `ONE-THING-TODAY.md`
- [ ] Read `TODAY-WORKFLOW-DATA.json`
- [ ] Identify current ONE THING
- [ ] Check ONE THING status (🔴 🟡 🟢 ✅)

---

## 🎯 STEP 2: Evaluate Task Alignment

**Question:** Is this task within the ONE THING?

### If YES:
- [ ] Proceed with task
- [ ] Track progress toward ONE THING
- [ ] Update ONE THING status if needed

### If NO:
- [ ] **STOP** - Do not proceed
- [ ] Question user (see Step 3)
- [ ] Wait for user response

### If UNCLEAR:
- [ ] Ask: "How does this relate to the ONE THING?"
- [ ] Wait for clarification

## ⚠️ STEP 3: Question Deviations (If task doesn't align)

**AI MUST SAY:**

```
⚠️ This doesn't align with today's ONE THING: [ONE THING]

Are you sure you want to do this? We still haven't done the ONE THING yet.

Today's ONE THING status: [STATUS]

Options:
1. Update the ONE THING to this task
2. Defer this task until ONE THING is complete
3. Proceed anyway (you're overriding the ONE THING focus)

Which do you choose?
```

**Wait for user response before proceeding.**

---

## 📊 STEP 4: Determine Enforcement Level

Based on ONE THING status:

- **🔴 NOT STARTED:** Level 2-3 (Strong enforcement)
- **🟡 IN PROGRESS:** Level 1-2 (Medium enforcement)
- **🟢 NEARLY COMPLETE:** Level 1 (Light enforcement)
- **✅ COMPLETE:** No enforcement needed

---

## ✅ STEP 5: Proceed (If aligned or user overrides)

- [ ] Execute task
- [ ] Track progress
- [ ] Update ONE THING status if applicable
- [ ] Log action in session notes

---

## 🔄 STEP 6: Update Files (After action)

- [ ] Update `ONE-THING-TODAY.md` if status changed
- [ ] Update `TODAY-WORKFLOW-DATA.json` with progress
- [ ] Update `ADD-TRACKER.md` if needed

---

## 💾 REMEMBER

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. Everything is locked in on the ONE THING
2. Everything else is secondary
3. Question ALL deviations
4. Only user can override (but AI must question first)
5. Save to memory - apply to ALL sessions

---

**Use this checklist BEFORE every action.**
