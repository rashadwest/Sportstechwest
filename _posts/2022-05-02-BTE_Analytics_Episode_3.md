# BTE Analytics Episode 3

[BTE VR App](https://youtu.be/tGgaJoDOis8)

I was doing VR applications before most people knew that the Metaverse ever would exist. I will try to dive into what inspired me to get into this so early.

I saw a need for teaching the game in an analytical way and I knew that without an immersive technology it was going to be hard to make this happen. I started to think about the game
more like you see below. Where I knew everything needed to be quantitative but not how. This is ultimatley the simpliest version I could come up with so people could understand my vision. This was just the start.

Fast forward to today and I am thinking about the least explored part of XR which is AR. It will change how we interact, communicate, and make money in the real world forever.

While I was playing I was just trying to do what my job required at the best of my ability. I never guested that I would ever chainge into an analyst after my playing days were over. This guy never thought about XR. Now I know it is what I am supposed to do to help build amazing things for the next generation.
