## ⚡ The 3-Minute Daily Start

### Before You Start Work Today:

1. **Review Yesterday** (2 min)
   - What was completed? What carried over? Why?
  BallCODE full integration is in progress; today is about finishing the end-to-end run and capturing proof + a repeatable baseline.
   - What's my energy level? (1-10)
   7/10
   _______________

2. **Identify Your One Domino** (1 min)
   - What's the ONE task today that makes everything else easier?
   Finish BallCODE full integration end-to-end and produce proof links (build artifact + deployed URL + verification output).
   _______________
   - If I complete this, what compounds?
   Everything downstream becomes faster and safer because there’s a trusted baseline (rerun steps + known-good config).
   _______________

3. **Protect Deep Work** (30 sec)
   - When is my 2–3 hour focus window? 9:30am–12:00pm
   - Distractions OFF: Phone, Email, Slack, Tabs
  Everything off

**✅ Ready to start. Move one domino. 🚀**

This start will happen in two hours but I want you to get everything setup so each story is so good in regards to AI, coding, and math that Triangle Science and Math Acdemy and NC Science and Math would want to pay for it when I send it to my contacts. 

## 🎯 The 10 Core Principles (Quick Reference)

1. **Orchestrate** — ONE system/process at a time (don't multitask)
Focusing on BallCODE full integration (end-to-end run + proof + runbook).

Make sure if follows the block coding element in the documents to where they are teaching the robot the moves and to shoot

Play mode:

Training mode
You touch a block and you determine how the robot moves and shoots one block at a time to understand the concepts. 

The math mode is simple arthmetic and algebra using the same thought process 
10(2+1) = 30
- 2 (Crossover) + 1 (Pound) * 10 (Close shot) =  30 BTE Analytics score 

The coding mode 
- drag and drop blocks similar to scratch to program the robot

The chess mode
- 2 player robot against robot you have to guess where the robot is going on offense and visa versa. 

Figure out how to make it make sense

2. **Protect Deep Work** — 2–3 hours uninterrupted daily
9:30am–12:00pm

3. **Batch Contexts** — Group similar work (≤3 switches/day)
I only switch when I am trying to make sure that what you are using is correct to evolve the curriculum 

4. **Delegate with Context** — Goal, metric, escalation for every task
Goal: finish full integration end-to-end.
Delegations: verification checklist, log triage, runbook drafting.
Escalation: anything involving credentials/infra or repeated failure after one smallest fix.

5. **Use If–Then Rules** — Automate behavior decisions
If I want to learn basketball or just learn a sport it helps us learn that through a stem program. 

This is the new PE class as it can carry over to being able to play on the court or field

6. **Track Metrics** — Focus time, delegations, context switches
2.5 hours focus time, 3 delegations, < 5 context switches.

7. **Automate for Clarity** — AI handles repetitive, you handle strategy
Lets create automation for each thing. I just want to make it where we are only enhanceing 

In order that this is owned by me I want you to just give me the thought structure of each story and episode and how short they will be but I want to write the actual story. Give me a format doc to do the writting. 

8. **Move One Domino** — ONE task that makes everything easier
Finish BallCODE full integration end-to-end and produce proof links (build artifact + deployed URL + verification output).

9. **Audit Weekly** — Review systems and improve
Make sure I get the weekly audit every Sunday. Make sure the date/time feature is working. It is Saturday November 15th
Lets make sure our audit is comprehensive of what I wanted to accomplish and what was actually acomplished in a KPI format

10. **Protect Energy** — Monitor and match work to energy level
What is the most important task from your perspective and do you think that I am working on that task. 

I think if I can convey the value add to these teams by Tuesday this would be great. 

I want to know if this is the best use of my time from you that you think to make this happen.

## 🔋 Energy Matching (Quick Check)

- **Energy < 5** → Low-cognitive tasks or break
- **Energy 5-7** → Medium-cognitive tasks
- **Energy 7-10** → High-cognitive tasks (Deep Work, One Domino)

---

## 📊 Daily Metrics (Track These)

- Focus Time: 1 hour (target: 1 hour deep work at noon)
- Delegations Created: I want you to determine this (target: 3-5)
- Context Switches: ONLY when I need to change the content of a book etc. Outline for book (cursor), Book (me), Recored (me), Uploads to site and makes it where it is protected for paywall (cursor) (target: < 5)
- Energy Level: 9 / 10 (target: 7+)
- One Domino Completed: YES (YES/NO)

## 🎯 Today's One Domino

**Task:** _______________

**Why this domino?** (How does it make everything else easier?)
_______________

**Success Criteria:** _______________

---

## ⚠️ If–Then Rules (Activate These)

- [ ] If I catch myself switching contexts → then I pause and batch similar work
- [ ] If it's my Deep Work time → then I enter focus mode (all distractions off)
- [ ] If AI confidence < 80% → then I review before accepting
- [ ] If energy < 4 → then I rest/reset (not a luxury, it's performance strategy)
- [ ] If One Domino not identified → then I pause and identify it before starting

---

## 📅 End of Day Check

Give this to me when I say I am done for the day

- [ ] One Domino Completed: YES / NO
- [ ] Focus Time: _______________ hours
- [ ] Energy Level: _______________ / 10
- [ ] Tomorrow's One Domino: _______________
