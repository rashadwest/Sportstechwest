# Coding Rebound

I just wanted to tell you that I figured it out. I have been working on coding out my analytics sequences anfd have talked to the team about what I am doing. Here is just a
snapshot of the begining codee I was creating for the analytic.

Here I figured out how to add the CSV file. The things I am trying to figure out now is how do I add the CSV to the
![This is the database csv file]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/blog-img/Database%20I%20will%20use.webp?raw=true)

I created my own database through code but I might as well use the CSV file as a base now that I can upload it.
![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/blog-img/Code%20for%20database.webp?raw=true)

Here is the output for what I created. I need to edit it so it is organized but it is a success.
![]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/blog-img/Database%20output.webp?raw=true)

Here is everything I am looking to accomplish in the code. I will need to focus in to see this through.
