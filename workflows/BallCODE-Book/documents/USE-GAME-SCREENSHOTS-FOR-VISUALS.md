## 🎯 GREAT IDEA!

**You're right!** Using game screenshots is **MUCH BETTER** than generating new illustrations because:
- ✅ **Already exists** - No need to generate
- ✅ **Matches your game** - Consistent visual style
- ✅ **Faster** - 5-10 minutes vs 35-45 minutes
- ✅ **Authentic** - Shows actual game visuals

## 📸 WHICH GAME SCREENSHOTS TO USE

### **1. Court Map Visual** 🏀
**What We Need:** Basketball court showing the center circle

**Best Screenshots to Use:**
- `Main Menu.png` - Shows the court with grid pattern
- `Tutorial_1.png` - Shows court layout
- `Coding_Gameplay_1.png` - Shows court with coding interface
- Any tutorial screenshot showing the court

**Recommendation:** Use `Main Menu.png` or `Tutorial_1.png` - they show the court clearly

---

### **2. Shadow Press Scouts Character Art** 👥
**What We Need:** Basketball player/character (the "villains")

**Best Screenshots to Use:**
- `Tutorial_1.png` through `Tutorial_17.png` - Show game characters/robots
- `Coding_Gameplay_1.png` - Shows player characters
- `Mathlete_Gameplay_1.png` - Shows game characters
- Any screenshot showing the robots/players

**Recommendation:** Use a tutorial screenshot showing the defensive/opposing team characters

---

### **3. State Diagram Visualization** 📊
**What We Need:** Educational diagram showing possession states

**Best Screenshots to Use:**
- `Coding_Gameplay_1.png` - Shows coding blocks (could represent states)
- `Tutorial_1.png` - Shows game state visually
- OR: Create a simple diagram using game visual style

**Recommendation:** Use a coding gameplay screenshot OR create a simple diagram using game colors/style
