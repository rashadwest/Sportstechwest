## 🎮 WHAT IS GAME EMBEDDING? (ELI10)

**Think of it like this:**

Right now, when you want to play the game, you have to:
1. Go to the book page
2. Click a link
3. Go to a DIFFERENT website
4. Enter a password
5. Then play the game

**That's like:** Having to leave your house, walk to a friend's house, knock on the door, and then play a game together.

## ✅ WHAT GAME EMBEDDING MEANS

**With game embedding, it would be like:**
1. Go to the book page
2. Click "Play Game" button
3. Game appears RIGHT ON THE SAME PAGE
4. Play immediately!

**That's like:** Having your friend come to YOUR house, and you play together right there!

## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS (Simple Version)

**It's like putting a window in your website:**
- The game is on another website (like a friend's house)
- But you put a "window" (called an iframe) on your page
- People can see and play the game through that window
- They never have to leave your page!

**Technical:** It's like embedding a YouTube video, but it's your game!
