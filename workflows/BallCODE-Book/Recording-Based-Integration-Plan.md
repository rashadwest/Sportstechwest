# Recording-Based Integration Plan
## Hybrid Approach: Recorded Books + Career Connections Integration

**Approach:** Record Episode books as videos/audio, then integrate Career Connections and IBM SkillsBuild components  
**Timeline:** Faster than building full interactive systems  
**Flexibility:** Can add interactivity later while delivering content now

### What Gets Integrated (By Me)
- **Career Connections:** Add to each episode's materials
- **Extension Activities:** Career exploration exercises
- **Teacher Guides:** Complete lesson plans with career components
- **Portfolio Templates:** Student portfolio structure
- **Career Readiness Module:** Post-episode career preparation

### What Can Be Added Later (Hybrid)
