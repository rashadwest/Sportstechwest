# Data Science Course 
## Creating a Data Science Foundation 

In this blog post I will talk about what I learn from this course.  I think it is cool that Microsoft posted this resource.  
All of these free learning tools there is no excuse for me not to get it done. 

I have realized that data science has been around for a long time but the tools that I have at my disposal have not been.  
I am thankful for the time in which I am learning it. It is a blessing.
