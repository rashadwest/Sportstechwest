## Opening (30 seconds)

**Slide 1: Title Slide**

**Talking Point:**
"Thank you for your time today. I'm Rashad West, founder of BallCODE. I'm excited to share what we're building—a unique approach to STEM education that bridges sports and coding. I think there are some interesting partnership opportunities we could explore together."

**Body Language:**
- Confident, enthusiastic
- Make eye contact
- Smile

**Transition:**
"Let me start by sharing the problem we're solving..."

---

## The Problem (1 minute)

**Slide 2: The Challenge**

**Talking Point:**
"We have a massive opportunity—50 million students in grades 3-8 who need STEM education. But traditional coding education struggles with engagement, especially among underrepresented groups. There's a gap between what students love—like basketball—and what they need to learn—like coding."

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- 50+ million students (scale)
- Engagement problem (real issue)
- Underrepresented groups (social impact)
- Gap between interests and education (opportunity)

**Transition:**
"What if we could bridge that gap? That's what BallCODE does..."

---

## The Solution (1 minute)

**Slide 3: BallCODE Solution**

**Talking Point:**
"BallCODE is the first curriculum that truly bridges sports and coding. We use what kids already know—basketball—to teach what they need to learn—coding. We've created a progressive pathway that takes students from sports language to real Python programming."

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- First-of-its-kind (uniqueness)
- Uses existing knowledge (basketball)
- Progressive pathway (proven approach)
- 70% story, 30% instruction (engagement)

**Transition:**
"Let me show you how it works..."

---

## How It Works (2 minutes)

**Slide 4: Three-Phase Pathway**

**Talking Point:**
"We start with Phase 1: Sports Language. Students learn using basketball terminology in a visual block interface—no typing required. They drag blocks together: 'If player is open, then pass the ball.'"

**Demonstration (if possible):**
- Show block coding interface (if available)
- Or: Describe the experience

**Continue:**
"Then in Phase 2, we show them how sports language maps to code. They see blocks and code side-by-side, understanding that blocks equal code. Finally, in Phase 3, they progress to Python syntax, learning the same concepts in a different representation. They end up with real-world programming skills."

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Natural progression (sports → code → Python)
- No prior knowledge required (accessible)
- Real skills (not just games)

**Transition:**
"Let me show you what this looks like in practice—Episode 1..."

---

## Episode 1 Demo (3 minutes) - CRITICAL SECTION

**Slide 5: Episode 1 Preview**

**Talking Point:**
"This is Episode 1: The Tip-off Trial. It's completely developed and ready. The learning focus is state management—understanding variables and state transitions. But students experience it through a basketball story about managing possession from tip-off."

**DEMO: Show Episode 1 Website**

**Steps:**
1. Open Episode 1 website (ballcode.co/episode1 or local demo)
2. Show the story content
3. Scroll through Act I, Act II, Act III
4. Show Skill Pit-Stop section
5. Show exercises section

**Talking Points During Demo:**
- "Here's the story—engaging narrative, 1,497 words, age-appropriate for grades 3-8"
- "This is the Skill Pit-Stop—direct instruction on the coding concept"
- "And here are the exercises—hands-on practice"
- "Notice how the basketball context makes the coding concept intuitive"

**QR Code Demo (if time):**
- "We also have QR codes for instant access"
- Scan QR code live (if possible)
- Show how it works

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Episode 1 is complete and ready
- Story-first approach (engagement)
- Basketball context (accessible)
- Complete learning unit (story + instruction + practice)

**Transition:**
"This is just Episode 1. We've designed a complete 12-episode curriculum..."

---

## Curriculum Overview (2 minutes)

**Slide 6: 12-Episode Curriculum**

**Talking Point:**
"We've structured BallCODE as 12 self-contained episodes, each a complete learning unit. Episode 1 teaches state management. Episode 2 teaches conditional logic. Episode 3 teaches loops. And so on, building progressively to Episode 12, which integrates AI tools."

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- 12 episodes (complete curriculum)
- Progressive skill building (systematic)
- Each episode: Story + Skill Pit-Stop + Exercise + Mastery Lab
- Complete pathway from basics to AI

**Transition:**
"Students don't just learn coding. They learn computational thinking, mathematics, and problem-solving..."

---

## Educational Outcomes (1 minute)

**Slide 7: What Students Learn**

**Talking Point:**
"Students learn coding skills—variables, conditionals, loops, functions, algorithms, debugging, AI integration. They learn mathematics—Boolean logic, probability, optimization, data analysis. And they develop 21st century skills—computational thinking, problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration."

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Comprehensive learning (not just coding)
- Standards aligned (CSTA, Common Core, NGSS)
- Real skills (career preparation)

**Transition:**
"Which brings me to why I'm here today—partnership opportunities..."

## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: How is this different from Scratch or other coding education?**
**A:** "Great question. Scratch teaches coding, but it's abstract. BallCODE uses a context kids already understand—basketball—to make coding concepts intuitive. Plus, we progress to real Python, not just blocks. And our story-first approach creates engagement that abstract coding tools don't."

**Q: What's the evidence this works?**
**A:** "Episode 1 is ready for testing. We're looking for pilot programs to validate learning outcomes. That's part of why we're interested in partnership—we want to do research and validation studies. But the approach is based on proven educational methods: story-based learning, visual block coding, progressive complexity."

**Q: How scalable is this?**
**A:** "Very scalable. We've designed a 12-episode core curriculum, but the structure can expand to multiple sports—soccer, football, baseball. We can create advanced modules, teacher training, assessment tools. The foundation is built for growth."

**Q: What do you need from IBM?**
**A:** "We're open to exploring different partnership models. Technology integration—like IBM Watson—would be exciting. Distribution and reach would help us scale. Research partnerships would validate outcomes. Co-development could adapt the curriculum for specific contexts. We're flexible and want to find the right fit."

**Q: What's the timeline?**
**A:** "Episode 1 is ready now. We can start pilot programs immediately. The full 12-episode curriculum would take 6-12 months to complete, depending on resources. But we have the structure and Episode 1 as proof of concept."

**Q: How does this fit with IBM's educational initiatives?**
**A:** "IBM has a strong focus on STEM education and workforce development. BallCODE addresses the engagement problem in STEM education, especially for underrepresented groups. We think there's alignment with IBM's goals around making technology education accessible and engaging."
