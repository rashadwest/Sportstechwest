## PROS of Adding AIMCODE Website to Rules

### 1. Systematic Problem Solving ✅
- **Benefit:** Provides structured framework for all website issues
- **Impact:** HIGH - Prevents ad-hoc fixes, ensures thorough analysis
- **Example:** Repository mismatch issue would have been caught earlier with systematic layer verification

### 2. Consistency Across Website Work ✅
- **Benefit:** All website changes follow same methodology
- **Impact:** HIGH - Reduces errors, improves quality
- **Example:** Every deployment would include verification checklist

### 3. Documentation of Solutions ✅
- **Benefit:** Real-world problems and solutions documented
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Prevents repeating mistakes
- **Example:** Common problems section saves time on future issues

### 4. Expert Consultation Built-In ✅
- **Benefit:** Jobs (simplicity) and Hassabis (systematic) perspectives applied
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Better design decisions
- **Example:** Would have simplified repository configuration earlier

### 5. Verification Best Practices ✅
- **Benefit:** Layer-by-layer verification prevents silent failures
- **Impact:** HIGH - Catches issues before they reach production
- **Example:** Would have caught repository mismatch immediately

### 6. Sector-Specific Focus ✅
- **Benefit:** Tailored to website development needs
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - More relevant than generic AIMCODE
- **Example:** Deployment pipeline specific, not generic content creation

## CONS of Adding AIMCODE Website to Rules

### 1. Potential Overhead ⚠️
- **Concern:** May slow down simple website changes
- **Impact:** LOW - Framework is flexible, can be lightweight for simple tasks
- **Mitigation:** Use lightweight AIMCODE for simple changes, full for complex issues

### 2. Learning Curve ⚠️
- **Concern:** Team needs to learn framework
- **Impact:** LOW - Framework is well-documented, intuitive
- **Mitigation:** Clear documentation, examples provided

### 3. May Not Apply to All Website Work ⚠️
