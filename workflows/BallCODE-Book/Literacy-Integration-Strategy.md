## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive, research-backed strategy for integrating three critical literacies—AI literacy, math literacy, and coding literacy—into the BallCODE episode series. Each episode will explicitly teach and assess these literacies while maintaining the basketball-as-framework approach.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Interdisciplinary Integration:** Concepts are taught together, not in isolation
2. **Age-Appropriate Progression:** Complexity increases from grades 3-5 to 6-8
3. **Project-Based Learning:** Hands-on application of concepts
4. **Evidence-Based:** Grounded in peer-reviewed research
5. **Clear Learning Objectives:** Explicitly stated and measurable
