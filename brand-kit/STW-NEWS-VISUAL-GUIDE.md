# STW News — Visual & Image Guide

**Purpose:** Quick sportstech current-events videos (e.g. ElevenLabs). Main on-screen = **"STW News"** (or "Sportstechwest News"); Sportstechwest = small logo in corner, per VIDEO-BRANDING-SPORT-FIRST.

---

## 1. STW News title card / opener

**Lead with "STW News" (or "Sportstechwest News")** — not the channel name as the only element. Small Sportstechwest logo in one corner (e.g. bottom-right).

### Options for the image

| Option | Description | Use when |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **A. Solid + text** | One background color + "STW News" (or "Sportstechwest News") in clean type. Use a sportstech-appropriate color: e.g. **black** (#000000) or **deep blue** (#1A237E) from SPORT-BACKGROUND-COLORS. | Default opener; works for every story. |
| **B. Subtle sport texture** | Same as A but with very subtle gradient or texture (e.g. stadium lights, data grid) so it still reads as "news" not "sport-specific." | When you want a bit more visual interest. |
| **C. Story-specific card** | "STW News" at top; below it one line for the story (e.g. "Orreco + Jennis" / "FIFA AI Avatars"). Same corner logo. | When the opener doubles as the story title. |

### Specs (match existing brand)

- **Background:** Black (#000000) or deep blue (#1A237E). Avoid busy imagery behind the main text.
- **Main text:** "STW News" or "Sportstechwest News" — large, readable, high contrast (e.g. white or light gray).
- **Corner logo:** Sportstechwest from `brand-kit/channel-logos/` — small, one corner (e.g. bottom-right), same as RunIQ/VisualizeIQ.
- **Aspect:** 16:9 (1920×1080) or 9:16 (1080×1920) depending on platform (YouTube Shorts = 9:16).

### Quick build

- **Canva:** Black or dark blue background → text "STW News" → add Sportstechwest logo in corner → export 16:9 or 9:16.
- **AI image:** Not required; a simple text-on-color card is enough. If you generate a background, keep it minimal so "STW News" stays the focus.

## 2. Using images or video from the actual apps

**Short answer:** Don’t pull random screenshots or in-app video from Jennis, Teamworks, Sportlogiq, FIFA tools, etc. for your own thumbnails or B-roll without permission. Use official, public assets instead.

### Safe to use (no need to "pull from the app")

| Source | What to use | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Press releases / press kits** | Official images and videos that companies publish (e.g. "Orreco acquires Jennis" announcement images, Teamworks/Sportlogiq merger graphics). | Best option. Check company newsroom or PR. |
| **App store / product pages** | Screenshots and promo images from App Store, Google Play, or the company’s own website. | Often allowed for editorial/review use; keep attribution in description. |
| **Official social / YouTube** | Clips from the company’s own YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn (e.g. product demos, FIFA’s own VAR/avatar explainers). | Use short clips for commentary; credit in caption/description. |
| **FIFA / governing bodies** | FIFA’s own footage and images for World Cup tech (e.g. CES announcement, official VAR/avatar materials). | Use as B-roll for news/commentary; attribute. |

### Avoid (unless you have permission)

- **Your own screenshots of someone else’s app** used as the main visual or thumbnail. ToS usually prohibit commercial/promotional use; can be unclear for "news."
- **Screen recordings of app UI** as B-roll without checking the company’s media/usage policy.
- **Unofficial or fan-made app compilations** that you don’t own or have rights to.

### Practical approach for STW News

1. **Opener:** Your own **STW News** card (above) — no app assets needed.
2. **Story visuals:** Prefer **official press images**, **app store assets**, or **company/federation YouTube clips** with clear attribution in the description (e.g. "Footage: FIFA" / "Image: Orreco").
3. **Commentary:** Your ElevenLabs script is the main value; short, attributed clips or stills are supporting only.

- **Logo asset:** `brand-kit/channel-logos/` (see CHANNEL-LOGOS.md).
