**Copyright © 2025 Rashad West. All Rights Reserved.**

**Date:** December 20, 2025  
**Goal:** Move through Books 3-5 stories quickly  
**Strategy:** Streamlined process, automation, focus on speed

## ⚡ FAST-TRACK STRATEGY

### **Core Principle:**
**Stories are short (1,200-1,800 words). Move fast. Quality comes from structure, not perfectionism.**

### **Speed Tactics:**
1. ✅ Use improved outlines (already done)
2. ✅ Follow 3-act structure (proven pattern)
3. ✅ Don't overthink - write first draft quickly
4. ✅ Polish later if needed (but stories work as-is)
5. ✅ Automate push process (save time)

## 📚 BOOK 3: THE PATTERN LOOP

### **Tonight's Plan:**
- **Time:** 1-2 hours (stories are short!)
- **Process:**

  4. Write Act III (~500 words) - 20-30 min
  5. Quick review (10 min)
  6. Save and push

### **Key Focus:**
- Loops (primary) - repeat patterns, break them
- Data (secondary) - helps find patterns
- Basketball action drives everything

### **After Writing:**
