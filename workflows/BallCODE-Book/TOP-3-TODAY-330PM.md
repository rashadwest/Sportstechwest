## 🥇 TOP 3 PRIORITIES

### 1. **Write Book 1 Story (Dribble Level 1 - Pound)** ⭐⭐⭐
**Time:** 30-45 minutes  
**Why This First:** Content is the foundation. Without the story, nothing else matters.

**Action:**
- Open `BOOK-1-OUTLINE-DRIBBLE-LEVEL-1.md` (already created)
- Open `STORY-WRITING-FORMAT-TEMPLATE.md` (already created)
- Write complete story following 3-act structure
- Target: 1,200-1,800 words
- Focus: Basketball action first, concepts emerge naturally

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete story written (all 3 acts)
- [ ] Word count: 1,200-1,800 words
- [ ] Quality checklist met (basketball framework, concepts emerge, engaging)

**Why This Matters:** This is the content that Triangle Science & Math and NC Science & Math will evaluate. Quality here determines everything.

### 2. **Record Book 1 (Browser Recording, High Quality)** ⭐⭐⭐
**Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Why This Second:** Proves the recording workflow works. Can't upload without recording.

**Action:**
- Test browser recording first (10-second test)
- Record Book 1 story reading
- Settings: 1080p minimum, 30fps minimum
- Save as: `Book-1-Dribble-Level-1.mp4`

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Recording quality tested and confirmed
- [ ] Book 1 recorded completely
- [ ] Audio clear, video quality good
- [ ] File saved with correct name

**Why This Matters:** Recording is the bridge between writing and uploading. Must work for the system to function.

---

### 3. **Get Book 1 Uploaded to Website with Paywall Functional** ⭐⭐⭐
**Time:** 5-10 minutes (you review, AI handles upload)  
**Why This Third:** Proves the end-to-end workflow. Shows you can actually sell books.

**Action:**
- You: Review recording, confirm it's ready
- AI: Upload video to website
- AI: Set up paywall (book-by-book payment)
- AI: Format page for optimal viewing
- You: Test payment flow (if time allows)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Book 1 visible on website
- [ ] Paywall functional (can select book for purchase)
- [ ] Page formatted properly
- [ ] Payment option visible (even if not fully tested)

**Why This Matters:** This proves the entire system works. You can show Triangle Science & Math and NC Science & Math a working product, not just plans.
