# MovesHacker

We are a team of individuals at BTE that look at moves and codes them using our algorithm. We will eventually have a database of all the basketball moves.

and what moves are most efficient, proficient, and effective for each player.

If you think about it in every sport no one has explored what it is that helps a player create space. We will look at attacking moves and determine what it
is that makes each player effecitve at getting away from their defender.

It is all for a good cause as we will be teaching youth STREAM (Science, Tech, Enginerring, Arts, Math) along this journey.
