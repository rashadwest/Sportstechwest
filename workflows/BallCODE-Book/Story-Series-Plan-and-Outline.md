# BallCODE Story Series — Plan & Outline

Working Title: "BallCODE: Unlocking the Secret Code of Sport and Beyond"
Audience: Elementary & Middle school students (grades 3–8); teachers/parents welcome
Tone: Story-first, adventurous, practical learning
Format: 12 self-contained episodes (read in any order), plus appendices

---

## Series Purpose
- Make coding, math, and AI feel natural through basketball stories
- Each episode = a memorable adventure + a concrete skill
- Deliver a classroom-ready structure: story → concept → challenge → practice

## Notion Structure (for production)
- Database Name: "BallCODE Story Series"
- Views: Current Work (Draft/In Review), Production (group by Status), Curriculum (Episode #, Focus, Coding, Math)
- Page Template sections: Premise, Story Beats (Act I/II/III), On-Court Objective, Coding Concept, Math Concept, AI Mechanic, Climax Challenge, Exercises, Assets, Glif Prompts

## Production Workflow
1. Outline → Draft → In Review → Edited → Final → Published
2. Create play + code diagrams; generate Glif art per episode
3. Classroom pack per episode: PDF story, worksheet, diagrams

## Episode One-Liners (12)
1. The Tip-off Trial — Win the first advantage by managing possession state.
2. The If/Then Fork in the Key — Beat traps using if/else reads in pick-and-roll.
3. Loop of the Rotating Guardians — Sustain perfect closeouts with rotation loops.
4. Pattern of the Phantom Zone — Detect zone patterns and attack the seam.
5. The Ledger of Possessions — Model a possession with data that can replay.
6. The Function of Twin Screens — Call sets like functions with counters.
7. Roster of the Rings — Build lineups from arrays; filter for the goal.
8. The Math of the Arc — Choose shots by percentages and expected value.
9. Algorithm of the Final Play — Select an end-game algorithm, then simulate.
10. The Debugging Dungeon — Trace recurring mistakes and fix root causes.
11. The Schema Forge — Upgrade your model to capture real basketball meaning.
12. The AI Oracle — Use an assistant safely with confidence, why, and fallbacks.

## Roadmap: Next Sport Series (Soccer)

- Immediately after Basketball, produce a Soccer edition with the same story-first + Skill Pit‑Stop structure.
- Reuse the Notion database schema; change Basketball Focus → Soccer Focus (e.g., Passing Lanes, Press Breakout, Set Pieces, Offside Line, Transition, Finishing, Shape/Spacing).
- Adapt episode templates: monsters/locations/themes mapped to soccer tactics and decisions.
- Keep CTAs and Mastery Labs pattern; new drills point to soccer mini-games.
- Target timeline: Outline (2 weeks), Drafts (6–8 weeks), Review/Assets (3–4 weeks), Publish (2 weeks).
