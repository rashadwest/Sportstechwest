# Episode Positioning Guide
## How to Structure Each Episode Using Basketball as Framework

**Purpose:** This guide ensures every episode uses basketball stories as the framework to teach AI, math, and coding concepts.

---

## The Framework Approach

### Basketball = Framework (The Vehicle)
- Engaging narrative that makes learning accessible
- Students understand basketball context immediately
- Basketball terminology used naturally
- Basketball success = proof of learning

### AI + Math + Coding = What Students Learn (The Destination)
- Concepts emerge FROM basketball needs
- Students see practical application immediately
- Learning happens through basketball problem-solving
- Mastery demonstrated through basketball success

---

## Three-Act Structure (3 Buckets) - MANDATORY

Every episode MUST follow this structure:

### **Act I: Setup and Problem (Basketball Context)**
**Purpose:** Establish basketball situation and introduce the challenge

**Structure:**
1. Start with basketball action (tip-off, pick-and-roll, zone defense, etc.)
2. Show basketball problem/challenge
3. Introduce characters in basketball context
4. AI/math/coding concepts hinted at but not explained yet

**Example (Episode 1):**
- Basketball action: Tip-off begins
- Problem: Team can't control possession, ball keeps getting stolen
- Context: Shadow Press Scouts create chaos
- Hint: "The state keeps changing too fast"

**Word Count:** ~400-500 words

### **Act II: Learning and Struggle (Concepts Emerge)**
**Purpose:** Show how AI/math/coding concepts solve basketball problems

**Structure:**
1. Basketball challenge intensifies
2. Characters realize they need help (AI, math, coding)
3. Concepts emerge naturally from basketball needs
4. Characters learn to use concepts to solve basketball problems
5. Struggle makes the solution meaningful

**Example (Episode 1):**
- Challenge: Turnovers keep happening
- Need: "We need to track when possession changes"
- Concept emerges: State tracking (START, LIVE, DEAD, OUTCOME)
- AI helps: Arc detects state shifts and asks for confirmation
- Math helps: Counting possessions and turnovers
- Learning: "If we track the state, we can control the game"

**Word Count:** ~500-600 words

### **Act III: Resolution and Application (Success Through Concepts)**
**Purpose:** Demonstrate mastery through basketball success

**Structure:**
1. Characters apply learned concepts to basketball situation
2. Basketball success achieved using AI/math/coding
3. Connection made clear: "This concept helped us win"
4. Climax challenge completed
5. Reflection on what was learned

**Example (Episode 1):**
- Application: Team tracks state through transition
- Success: Maintain possession through 3 linked actions
- Connection: "State tracking helped us control the game"
- Climax: No turnovers, clean transition
- Reflection: "What variables mattered most?"

**Word Count:** ~400-500 words

**Total Story:** 1,300-1,600 words (70% story, 30% skill inserts)

- [ ] Basketball context is engaging and clear throughout

### Concept Integration
- [ ] AI concepts emerge from basketball needs (not explained first)
- [ ] Math concepts solve basketball problems (not abstract)
- [ ] Coding concepts organize basketball actions (not theoretical)
- [ ] Concepts feel natural, not forced
- [ ] Basketball success proves concept mastery

### Engagement
- [ ] Story reads like an adventure, not a lesson
- [ ] Students will want to read it (not just learn from it)
- [ ] Basketball terminology used naturally
- [ ] Characters are engaging and relatable
- [ ] 70% story, 30% skill inserts maintained

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Starting with Concepts
**Wrong:** "Today we're learning about state management. State is when..."
**Right:** "The ball bounced between players, each touch creating chaos..."

### ❌ Explaining Before Showing
**Wrong:** "State management helps us track possession. Let's see how..."
**Right:** "Nova's head spun trying to track it all. 'What's the current state?'"

### ❌ Making Basketball Secondary
**Wrong:** "We'll use basketball as an example of state management..."
**Right:** "The Shadow Press Scouts were forcing turnovers. Nova needed to track the state..."

### ❌ Breaking 3-Act Structure
**Wrong:** Explaining concepts in Act I, showing basketball in Act III
**Right:** Basketball in Act I, concepts emerge in Act II, success in Act III

## Key Principles

1. **Basketball First:** Every scene starts with basketball action
2. **Concepts Emerge:** AI/math/coding come from basketball needs
3. **Success Proves Learning:** Basketball success = concept mastery
4. **3 Acts Always:** Setup → Struggle → Resolution
5. **Engaging Always:** Story must be fun to read, not just educational
