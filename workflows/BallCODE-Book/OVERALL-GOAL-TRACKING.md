- ✅ Enables consistent teaching across website, books, curriculum, and game
- ✅ Unblocks game development (knowing what to build)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Clean website with curriculum pathway visible
- [ ] Books show what students learn (curriculum connection)
- [ ] Game exercises connect to books and curriculum
- [ ] Curriculum guides students to next book
- [ ] Complete learning loop: Website → Book → Game → Curriculum → Next Book

**Progress:** 75% - Integration architecture complete, implementation in progress

## ⚠️ Critical Blockers & Dependencies

### Immediate Blockers
1. **Visual Assets (0%)** - Blocks Episode 1 completion, website updates, IBM presentation
2. **Book Production (0%)** - Blocks revenue generation, target school outreach
3. **Paywall System (0%)** - Blocks revenue generation

### Dependencies
- **Books 1-3** → Must complete before Books 4-7 (workflow establishment)
- **Paywall System** → Must complete before revenue generation
- **Content Quality** → Must meet standards before target school outreach
- **Visual Assets** → Needed for Episode 1, but not blocking book production

### Risk Mitigation
- **Visual Assets:** Can proceed with books without visuals (videos don't need static images)
- **Unity Integration:** Can launch books standalone, integrate later
- **Website Updates:** Can use simple pages initially, enhance later

---

## 📅 Timeline & Deadlines

### This Week
- **Today:** Books 1-3 complete (written, recorded, uploaded)
- **Tomorrow:** Books 4-7 complete (written, recorded, uploaded)
- **Tuesday:** Value presentation to target school contacts

### Next Week
- **Week 3:** Unity integration, game exercises, QR codes
- **Week 4:** Beta testing, pilot programs, outreach expansion

### Long-term
- **Month 1:** 7 books live, paywall functional, first sales
- **Month 2-3:** Pilot programs active, case studies developing
- **Month 4-6:** Institutional licensing, revenue scaling

## 📊 Overall Goal Health Check

**Current Status:** 🟡 **65% Complete**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Book 1 complete and live (story, video, Gumroad, website)
- ✅ Book 3 framework complete (outline, integration maps, game specs, website pages)
- ✅ Integration architecture documented (URL parameters, return flow, curriculum maps)
- ✅ Sales materials ready (Book 3 sales package)
- ✅ Curriculum pathway visible on website
- ✅ Planning and documentation complete (100%)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Book 2 story not written (outline ready)
- ❌ Book 3 story not written (framework ready)
- ❌ Website deployment/push issues (files created but not pushed to live site)
