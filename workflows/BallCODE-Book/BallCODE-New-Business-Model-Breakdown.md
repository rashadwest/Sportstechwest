### Story Mode: The Engagement Engine

**Story Mode is the core differentiator** - it's not just content, it's the **primary engagement mechanism** that:
- Teaches coding concepts through narrative
- Seamlessly transitions to interactive game exercises
- Creates emotional connection with characters
- Provides context for abstract coding concepts

**Story Mode Features:**
- ✅ Page-turner interface (Unity-based)
- ✅ Audiobook narration (syncs with pages)
- ✅ Deep linking from QR codes (physical book integration)
- ✅ Progress tracking across episodes
- ✅ Seamless game mode transitions
- ✅ Return flow after exercise completion
