## Career Spotlight: Conditional Logic in Tech Careers

**Conditional logic** (if/then/else statements) is one of the most fundamental coding concepts used in virtually every software application. Understanding how to make decisions based on conditions is essential for all technology careers.

#### Careers That Use Conditional Logic

1. **Software Engineer / Developer**
   - **What they do:** Build web applications, mobile apps, and software systems
   - **How they use conditionals:** Every program uses if/then logic to make decisions - user authentication, form validation, feature toggles, error handling
   - **Real example:** "If user is logged in, show dashboard; else show login page"
   - **Education:** Bachelor's in Computer Science or related field, coding bootcamp, or self-taught with portfolio

2. **Data Analyst**
   - **What they do:** Analyze data to help businesses make decisions
   - **How they use conditionals:** Filter data based on conditions, create reports for specific scenarios, categorize data
   - **Real example:** "If sales > $10,000, mark as high priority; else mark as standard"
   - **Education:** Bachelor's in Data Science, Statistics, Business Analytics, or related field

3. **Game Developer**
   - **What they do:** Create video games for consoles, computers, and mobile devices
   - **How they use conditionals:** Game logic is full of conditionals - if player has key, open door; if health < 0, game over; if score > high score, save record
   - **Real example:** "If player presses jump button AND player is on ground, then jump; else ignore input"
   - **Education:** Bachelor's in Game Development, Computer Science, or related field

4. **Systems Analyst**
   - **What they do:** Analyze and design computer systems for organizations
   - **How they use conditionals:** Design business rules, workflow logic, system behaviors based on conditions
   - **Real example:** "If order total > $100, apply free shipping; else charge $5 shipping"
   - **Education:** Bachelor's in Information Systems, Computer Science, or Business with tech focus

5. **Business Analyst**
   - **What they do:** Bridge business needs with technology solutions
   - **How they use conditionals:** Define business rules, create decision trees, specify system requirements
   - **Real example:** "If customer is premium member, apply 20% discount; else apply standard pricing"
   - **Education:** Bachelor's in Business, Information Systems, or related field

## Career Connection Activity (15-20 minutes)

**Objective:** Connect Episode 2's conditional logic concept to real-world tech careers.

**Materials:**
- Career research worksheet (optional)
- Internet access or career information handouts
- Presentation tools (poster paper, digital slides, etc.)

**Instructions:**

1. **Career Selection (3 minutes)**
   - Students choose one career from the list above (or teacher assigns)
   - Each student/group gets a different career

2. **Research (8-10 minutes)**
   - Research: "How does [career] use conditional logic (if/then/else)?"
   - Find one specific real-world example of conditional logic in that career
   - Identify 2-3 skills needed for this career
   - Note education/training requirements

3. **Share Findings (5-7 minutes)**
   - Each student/group presents findings (1-2 minutes each)
   - Class discusses: "What similarities did you notice across careers?"
   - Teacher highlights: "Conditional logic is used in every tech job!"

**Discussion Questions:**
- "Can you think of a video game that uses if/then logic? What decisions does it make?"
- "How might a mobile app use conditionals? (Hint: Think about what happens when you open an app)"
- "What happens if a program doesn't handle conditions correctly? (Hint: Think about when apps crash or behave unexpectedly)"
- "Which career interests you most? Why?"

**Extension for Advanced Students:**
- Research nested conditionals (if inside if)
- Find job postings that mention "conditional logic" or "decision trees"
- Write pseudocode for a real-world conditional scenario
- Interview a software developer about how they use conditionals

**Assessment:**
- Participation in research and presentation
- Quality of real-world example found
- Connection made between Episode 2 concept and career
- Understanding of how conditionals work in different careers

## Integration Notes for Teachers

**When to Use:**
- After completing Episode 2 story and exercises
- As an extension activity (15-20 minutes)
- Can be done in-class or as homework
- Can be individual or group work

**Curriculum Alignment:**
- **CSTA Standards:** Computing impacts and careers
- **21st Century Skills:** Career and life skills
- **Common Core:** Speaking and listening (presentation component)

**Differentiation:**
- **Struggling Students:** Provide career handouts, use simpler examples, pair with stronger students
- **Advanced Students:** Research nested conditionals, find job postings, write pseudocode
- **English Language Learners:** Use visual aids, provide vocabulary support, allow extra time
