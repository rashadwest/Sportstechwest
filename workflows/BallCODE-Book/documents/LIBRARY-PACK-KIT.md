# BallCODE Library Pack (Pitch + Acquisition + Programming)

**Purpose:** Make BallCODE easy for libraries to acquire and run as a repeatable STEM program.

## What BallCODE is (library-friendly description)
BallCODE is a story-driven book series that teaches coding and math through basketball. Students read a story moment, learn a concept, then apply it with a quick interactive challenge (or a paper-based activity when devices aren’t available).

## Why libraries say “yes”
- **High-interest theme:** sports + story pulls reluctant readers and curious STEM learners
- **Program-ready:** works as STEM club content, maker-space events, or family learning nights
- **Multiple entry points:** reading, discussion, hands-on activity, optional game challenge
- **Equity-friendly:** can run fully offline (print + worksheets) or with devices

## Email Pitch Template (to librarians)
**Subject:** A high-circulation STEM series: basketball + coding (program-ready)

Hi [Name],

I’m reaching out to share BallCODE, a story-driven book series that uses basketball as the narrative vehicle to teach coding and math skills. Each story connects to short challenges so students immediately apply what they read.

I’d love to offer [Library Name] a **Library Pack** that’s ready for STEM programming (clubs, maker-space events, family learning nights). If you share your preferred acquisition process, I can send ordering details and a one-page overview.

Best,
Rashad West

## 20-second in-person pitch
“These are basketball stories that quietly teach real coding and math. Kids read a story moment, then do a quick challenge—perfect for library STEM programs and high-interest circulation.”

---

## Program/Event Outline (45 minutes)

### Materials
- Story excerpt (printed or projected)
- “Skill of the day” one-pager
- Challenge cards (printed)
- Optional: 1 demo device to show the interactive challenge

### Flow
1. **Hook (5 min):** basketball moment + a simple coding question
2. **Read (10 min):** short excerpt from the story
3. **Skill of the day (8 min):** explain one concept (sequence, conditional, loop, or state)
4. **Hands-on activity (15 min):** paper-based challenge (students write the steps / choose-if-then / repeat-pattern)
5. **Optional demo (5 min):** show the interactive challenge
6. **Wrap (2 min):** what they learned + what to try next

### Success markers
- Students can restate the concept in their own words
- Students complete the paper challenge
- Students ask for the next book/challenge

## Program/Event Outline (60 minutes)
Same as the 45-minute plan, plus:
- small-group discussion
- student-created challenge (they design their own sequence/if-then/loop)

## Follow-up options
- Monthly BallCODE STEM club
- Summer reading tie-in (sports + STEM)
- Library-school partnership: library hosts, school distributes parent access
