## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE

**Subject:** Request: BallCODE WebGL Build Files for Netlify Deployment

---

Hi [Developer Name],

I'm setting up a new Netlify account for the BallCODE game and need the WebGL build files to deploy it. I want to keep everything exactly as it is - no code changes needed, just the build files.

**What I Need:**

**PRIORITY 1 - REQUIRED:**
The complete WebGL build folder (`Builds/WebGL/`) with all contents:
- `index.html`
- `Build/` folder (with .wasm, .js, .data files)
- `StreamingAssets/` folder (with level data JSON files)
- Any other assets or configuration files

**How to Provide:**
Please zip the entire `Builds/WebGL/` folder and share it via:
- Google Drive / Dropbox link, OR
- GitHub release/tag, OR
- Direct file transfer

**PRIORITY 2 - HELPFUL (Optional):**
- Unity version used for the build
- WebGL build settings (compression, memory size, etc.)
- Any environment variables or API keys the game needs

**PRIORITY 3 - OPTIONAL:**
- Access to current Netlify deployment (if you want me to download directly)
- Any deployment documentation or known issues

**Important Notes:**
- ✅ No code changes needed - just the build files
- ✅ Same build that's currently working
- ✅ Deployment will take ~15 minutes once I have the files

**Questions?**
If you have any questions or prefer a different method to share the files, just let me know. The WebGL build folder is the only critical requirement.

Thanks!

## 📧 SHORT VERSION (If Developer is Busy)

**Subject:** Quick Request: BallCODE WebGL Build Files

---

Hi [Developer Name],

Quick request - I need the WebGL build folder (`Builds/WebGL/`) to deploy BallCODE to a new Netlify account. 

Can you zip the `Builds/WebGL/` folder and share it? No code changes needed, just deploying the existing build.

Thanks!

## 📧 IF GAME IS ALREADY DEPLOYED

**Subject:** BallCODE WebGL Build - Download from Current Netlify?

---

Hi [Developer Name],

I'm setting up a new Netlify account for BallCODE. Since the game is already deployed at `ballcode.netlify.app`, would it be easier if I download the build files directly from the current Netlify deployment?

Or if you prefer, you can zip the `Builds/WebGL/` folder and share it.

Either way works - just need the WebGL build files to deploy to the new account. No code changes needed.

Thanks!
