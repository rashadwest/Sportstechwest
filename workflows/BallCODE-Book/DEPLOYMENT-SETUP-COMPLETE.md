## 🚀 How to Deploy Updates

### **Method 1: I Push Directly (Recommended)**

**What I'll do:**
1. Make changes to files locally
2. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
3. Push to your fork: `git push origin main`
4. Changes go live (if site is connected to GitHub)

**You just need to:**
- Make sure your hosting is connected to GitHub
- Or manually pull/deploy from GitHub if needed

### **Method 2: You Push Manually**

**If you prefer to control when changes go live:**

1. **I make changes locally**
2. **I commit changes**
3. **I tell you what changed**
4. **You push when ready:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/rashadwest/Sportstechwest/workflows/BallCODE-Book/BallCode
   git push origin main
   ```
