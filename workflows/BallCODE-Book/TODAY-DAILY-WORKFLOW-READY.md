## 🎯 TODAY'S ONE DOMINO

**What is the ONE task today that makes everything else easier or unnecessary?**
```
Task: Create, record, and upload 3 dribble-level books (Levels 1-3) to website with paywall
```

```

**What happens if I DON'T complete this today?**

```
- Revenue generation stays blocked (no sellable product)
- Can't present value to Triangle Science & Math, NC Science & Math by Tuesday
- Production workflow not established
- Website stays at 0%
- Paywall system not built
```

**What happens if I DO complete this today?**

   - Records at full browser resolution

2. **Loom Extension** (If available)
   - High quality (1080p)
   - Easy sharing
   - Browser-based

### Recording Settings for Best Quality:

**Resolution:**
- Minimum: 1920x1080 (1080p)
- Ideal: 2560x1440 (1440p) or 3840x2160 (4K) if available

**Frame Rate:**
- Minimum: 30 fps
- Ideal: 60 fps

**Audio:**
- Use external microphone if available
- Test audio levels before recording
- Record in quiet environment

**Browser Settings:**
- Full screen browser window
- Zoom at 100% (not zoomed in/out)
- Close unnecessary tabs
- Clear browser cache for faster loading

**Recording Tips:**
- Record in one continuous take (can edit later if needed)
- Pause between acts if needed (can be edited out)
- Test recording for 10 seconds first to check quality
- Save recordings with clear names: "Book-1-Dribble-Level-1.mp4"

## 📋 STORY QUALITY CHECKLIST

**Content Must Be:**
- [ ] Rigorous enough for advanced students (Triangle Science & Math, NC Science & Math)
- [ ] Clearly explains AI/math/coding concepts
- [ ] Engaging enough to hold attention
- [ ] Educational value evident
- [ ] Professional presentation

**Story Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Starts with basketball action (not concept explanation)
- [ ] Basketball terminology used naturally
- [ ] AI/math/coding concepts emerge FROM basketball needs
- [ ] 3-act structure followed
- [ ] Basketball success demonstrates mastery
- [ ] Engaging and adventurous (70% story, 30% skill)
- [ ] Word count: 1,200-1,800 words per book

---

## 💡 IS THIS THE BEST USE OF YOUR TIME?

### Assessment:

**✅ YES - This is the right focus because:**

1. **Revenue Generation:** Creates sellable product immediately
2. **Target Audience Ready:** Content for Triangle Science & Math, NC Science & Math contacts
3. **Production Workflow:** Establishes process for remaining 4 books
4. **Execution Gap:** Addresses the 0% website implementation
5. **Tuesday Deadline:** Gets content ready for value presentation by Tuesday

**⚠️ Considerations:**
- **Visual Assets:** Still at 0% - but not needed for video recordings
- **Game Integration:** Still at 30% - but books can be standalone initially
- **Outreach:** Still at 0% - but books are needed before outreach

**Recommendation:** **YES, proceed with books.** This creates immediate value and unblocks revenue. Visual assets and game integration can happen in parallel or after books are complete.
