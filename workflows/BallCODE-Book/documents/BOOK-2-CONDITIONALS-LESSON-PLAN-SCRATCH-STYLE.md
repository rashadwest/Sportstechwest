## ⏱️ LESSON STRUCTURE (45-60 minutes)

### Part 1: Introduction (5 minutes)

**Hook:**
"Have you ever made a decision? 'If it's raining, then I'll bring an umbrella. Else, I'll leave it at home.' That's a conditional - if something is true, do this; else, do that. Today, we're learning how computers make decisions!"

**Connection to Basketball:**
"Basketball players make decisions all the time. 'If the defender is near, then I'll crossover. Else, I'll drive to the basket.' Let's see how this works in code!"

**Learning Goal:**
"Today, we're learning about conditionals - making decisions in code."

---

### Part 2: Story Reading (10 minutes)

**Read:** Book 2, Episode 1 - "The Code of Flow"

**Key Moments to Pause:**

**After Act I:**
- "What decision did the player need to make?"
- "What were the two options?"

**After Act II:**
- "How did the player read the defense?"
- "What was the 'if' condition? What was the 'then' action?"

**After Act III:**
- "How did understanding conditionals help win the game?"

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What is a conditional? (If this, then that)
2. Why do we need conditionals? (To make decisions)
3. How is this like reading defense? (If defender is here, do this)

---

### Part 3: Skill Pit-Stop (5 minutes)

**Mini-Lesson: Conditionals**

**Visual Demonstration:**
Draw on whiteboard:
```
IF defender is near
  THEN crossover
ELSE
  drive to basket
```

**Explain:**
- "A conditional checks if something is true"
- "If true, do one thing; else, do another"
- "Like making a decision"

**Connect to Basketball:**
- "Reading defense is a conditional"
- "If defender is here, do this; else, do that"
- "Players make these decisions all the time"

---

### Part 4: Visual Block Introduction (10 minutes)

**Scratch-Style Approach:**

**Step 1: Show the IF Block (2 minutes)**
Display on screen/board:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ START               │
├─────────────────────┤
│ MOVE FORWARD        │
├─────────────────────┤
│ IF DEFENDER NEAR    │  (Orange C-shaped block)
│   THEN CROSSOVER    │  (Inside the IF)
│   ELSE CONTINUE     │  (Else branch)
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Explain:**
- "This is an IF block - it's C-shaped"
- "The condition goes in the top (DEFENDER NEAR)"
- "If true, do THEN; else, do ELSE"

**Step 2: Demonstrate (3 minutes)**
- Show IF block on screen
- Drag blocks inside the IF
- Explain: "This is a conditional - if defender is near, crossover; else, continue"

**Step 3: Students Try (5 minutes)**
- Students open BallCODE game
- Drag IF block
- Add THEN and ELSE blocks
- Try: IF DEFENDER NEAR → THEN CROSSOVER → ELSE DRIVE

**Circulate and Help:**
- "What happens if the defender is near?"
- "What happens if the defender is not near?"
- "Can you have more than one IF?"

---

### Part 5: Game Exercise (15 minutes)

**Exercise: One-on-One Decision**

**Instructions:**
1. Open the game exercise
2. Create a conditional for one-on-one
3. Use: IF DEFENDER NEAR → THEN CROSSOVER → ELSE DRIVE
4. Test your conditional
5. Debug if needed

**Scratch-Style Guidance:**
- Start simple: One IF block
- Test it: See if it works
- Add more: Multiple conditions
- Debug: Fix what doesn't work

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Conditional has IF, THEN, ELSE
- ✅ Condition makes sense (DEFENDER NEAR)
- ✅ Player reacts correctly
- ✅ Student can explain the conditional

**Differentiation:**
- **Struggling:** Provide starter conditional, students modify
- **On Track:** Students create their own conditional
- **Advanced:** Students create nested conditionals (IF inside IF)

---

### Part 6: Code Connection (5 minutes)

**Show the Bridge:**

**Blocks:**
```
START
  → MOVE FORWARD
  → IF DEFENDER NEAR
      THEN CROSSOVER
      ELSE DRIVE
```

**Python Code (Side-by-Side):**
```python
move_forward()
if defender_near():
    crossover()
else:
    drive()
```

**Explain:**
- "Blocks become code"
- "IF block = if statement"
- "THEN = code inside if"
- "ELSE = code in else branch"

**Students See:**
- Their blocks
- The Python code
- The connection

---

### Part 7: Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

**Reflection Questions:**
1. What is a conditional? (If this, then that)
2. Why do we need conditionals? (To make decisions)
3. How is this like basketball? (Reading defense)
4. What did you learn? (Share one thing)

**Extension:**
- "Create a conditional for a different situation"
- "What happens if you remove the ELSE?"
- "Try it at home: Make decisions using conditionals"

**Next Steps:**
- "Next time, we'll learn about loops - repeating actions!"
- "Keep practicing conditionals - they're how code makes decisions!"
