### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended - 3-5 Days)

**What:** Simple web page NOW + Unity build LATER

**Timeline:**

- Phase 2 (1-2 weeks): Upgrade to Unity WebGL

**Pros:**
- Get something to school quickly
- Upgrade later with full experience
- Best of both worlds

## What You Need to Decide

### Questions to Answer:

1. **Do you own `ballcode.co` domain?**
   - If yes: How long to configure?
   - If no: Need to purchase/configure (add 1-2 days)

2. **Do you have web hosting?**
   - If yes: What platform? (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
   - If no: Need to set up (add 1-2 days)

3. **Is Unity project ready for WebGL build?**
   - If yes: How long to build and deploy?
   - If no: Need to implement first (add 1-2 weeks)

4. **What's your priority?**
   - Speed (get to school ASAP) → Simple web page
   - Quality (full experience) → Unity WebGL
   - Both → Hybrid approach

---

## Recommendation

### Best Approach: Hybrid (Send This Week + Upgrade Later)

**Why:**
1. Get content to school quickly (this week)
2. They can start using it immediately
3. Upgrade to full experience in 1-2 weeks
4. Shows progress and responsiveness

**Action Plan:**
1. **This Week (3-5 days):**
   - Create simple web page with Episode 1 story
   - Deploy to hosting
   - Get URL: `ballcode.co/episode1` or similar
   - Send package with website link

2. **Next 1-2 Weeks:**
   - Build Unity WebGL version
   - Deploy full experience
   - Notify school of upgrade

3. **Ongoing:**
   - Collect feedback
   - Iterate based on usage

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on approach** (Simple web page vs Unity WebGL vs Hybrid)
2. **Confirm domain and hosting** status
3. **Create timeline** based on chosen approach
4. **Update pilot school package** with website information
5. **Send package** when website is ready (or send now with "coming soon" note)

## Communication to Pilot School

### If Website Ready This Week:
"We're excited to share that Episode 1 is now available online at [URL]. Students can access the story and exercises directly from any device."

### If Website Coming in 1-2 Weeks:
"Episode 1 content is ready for you to use now (attached). We're also building an online version that will be available in 1-2 weeks, which will make it even easier for students to access."

### If Using Hybrid:
"Episode 1 is available online now at [URL] (simple version). We're building an enhanced interactive version that will be ready in 1-2 weeks with full Unity story mode and game integration."

---

**Bottom Line:** You can send the package THIS WEEK with either:
- Simple website (if you can build in 3-5 days)
- "Coming soon" note (if website needs 1-2 weeks)

The content is ready - the website is just the delivery method!
