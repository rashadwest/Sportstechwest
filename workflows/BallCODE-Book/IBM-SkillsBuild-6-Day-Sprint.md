# IBM SkillsBuild Integration - 6-Day Sprint Plan
## Action Plan to Integrate Career Readiness Components

**Timeline:** 6 Days  
**Goal:** Demonstrate IBM SkillsBuild integration in BallCODE curriculum  
**Priority:** High-impact, quick-to-implement components  
**Approach:** Hybrid - Recorded Episode Books + Career Connections Integration

**NEW APPROACH:** You record the episode books (video/audio), I integrate Career Connections and create all supporting materials. This is faster and more practical than building full interactive systems.
