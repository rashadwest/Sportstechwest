   - "How does this relate to coding?"

### During Class

**Minute 0-5: Introduction**
- "Today we're learning about coding through basketball!"
- "We'll read a story, learn a concept, and practice with exercises."
- "No prior coding knowledge needed—we'll learn together."

**Minute 5-25: Read Story**
- Read Episode 1 aloud OR have students read independently
- Pause after Act I: "What states did you notice?"
- Pause after Act II: "How did Nova track the states?"
- After Act III: "How did they maintain the state?"

**Minute 25-30: Skill Pit-Stop**
- Review the four states together
- Use examples from the story
- Connect to coding: "Programs use states too!"

**Minute 30-50: Exercises**

## Troubleshooting

### "My students don't understand states"

**Solution:**
- Use the light switch analogy from Skill Pit-Stop
- Act out states physically (stand for LIVE, sit for DEAD)
- Use more examples from basketball
- Break it down: "What's happening RIGHT NOW?"

### "The story is too long/short"

**Solution:**
- Too long? Read in sections over multiple days
- Too short? Add discussion questions between acts
- Adjust pacing to your students' needs

### "Students aren't engaged"

**Solution:**
- Connect to their interests (video games, sports)
- Use the interactive game component (when available)
- Allow creativity in exercises
- Celebrate small successes

### "I don't have devices for the game"

**Solution:**
- The game is optional! Story + exercises work standalone
- Use paper exercises only
- Game can be added later when devices are available

### "I need more support"

**Solution:**
- Email: [Your Email]
- Response time: Within 24 hours
- We're here to help!
