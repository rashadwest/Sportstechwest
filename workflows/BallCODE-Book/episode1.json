It can't be both at the same time, and it can only change from one state to the other when you flip the switch.\n\nIn basketball, and in code, we use states to track what's happening. Just like a light switch, the game can only be in one state at a time, and it changes when something specific happens.\n\nThe Four States of Possession:\n1. START - When the play begins (tip-off)\n2. LIVE - When the ball is in play\n3. DEAD - When play stops\n4. OUTCOME - When the play ends with a result",
