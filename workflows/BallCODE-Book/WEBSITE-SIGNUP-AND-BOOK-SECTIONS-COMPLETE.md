## 🔒 CONTENT PROTECTION STRATEGY

### What's Visible (Safe to Show):
- ✅ Learning objectives and concepts
- ✅ Basketball skills taught
- ✅ Conceptual structure of exercises
- ✅ Simplified examples (not complete code)
- ✅ Educational approach and methodology

### What's Protected (Not Fully Shown):
- ❌ Complete code implementations
- ❌ Full exercise solutions
- ❌ Interactive block configurations
- ❌ Complete Python programs
- ❌ All exercise challenges and variations
- ❌ Assessment criteria and rubrics

### Protection Methods Used:

1. **Teaser Content Only**
   - Shows structure, not full implementation
   - Uses pseudocode/descriptive format
   - Mentions "full exercise includes" to indicate more

2. **Simplified Examples**
   - Code examples are incomplete
   - Missing key functions and logic
   - Not executable as-is

3. **Form Gating**
   - Email required to access full content
   - Creates engagement before revealing details
   - Builds email list for marketing

4. **Descriptive, Not Prescriptive**
   - Explains concepts, not exact code
   - Shows "what" not "how" in detail
   - Focuses on learning outcomes, not implementation
