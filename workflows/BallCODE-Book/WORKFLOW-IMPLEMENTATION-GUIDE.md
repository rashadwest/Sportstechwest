## 📋 Quick Reference: The 10 Rules

### 1️⃣ Orchestrate — Don't Multitask
- Focus on ONE system/process at a time
- Define ownership, automation, accountability

### 2️⃣ Protect Deep Work Windows
- 2-3 hours of uninterrupted focus daily
- Eliminate all distractions

### 3️⃣ Batch Similar Contexts
- Group similar work together
- Minimize context switches (target: ≤3 per day)

### 4️⃣ Delegate with Context
- Every delegation must answer:
  - What's the goal?
  - How will success be measured?
  - When should it escalate back to me?

### 5️⃣ Use If–Then Rules
- Automate behavior decisions
- Examples: "If 9 AM → Deep Work", "If AI confidence < 80% → Review"

### 6️⃣ Track Your Metrics Daily
- Focus Time
- Delegations Created
- Context Switches

### 7️⃣ Automate for Clarity, Not Complexity
- AI handles repetitive/reactive work
- You reserve time for creative direction, relationships, judgment

### 8️⃣ Move One Domino a Day
- What's the ONE task that makes everything else easier?
- Complete it first

### 9️⃣ Audit Systems Weekly
- Review automation and delegations weekly
- Fix small issues before they compound

### 🔟 Protect Energy Like a KPI
- Monitor energy levels (1-10)
- Schedule rest, reset, reflection

## 🎯 Integration with Cursor

### Option 1: Manual (Recommended for Start)

1. **Keep `CURSOR-CHAT-START-TEMPLATE.md` open in a tab**
2. **Before each new chat, copy/paste the template**
3. **Answer questions, then proceed**

### Option 2: Automated (Advanced)

1. **Create a Cursor snippet or macro** (if supported)
2. **Set up a keyboard shortcut** to insert the template
3. **Use a browser extension** to auto-insert on Cursor chat start

### Option 3: Reminder System

1. **Set a daily reminder** (phone/calendar) to complete the daily workflow
2. **Set a reminder** before each Cursor session to use the chat template

---

## 📊 Weekly Audit Process

**Every week (choose a consistent day):**

1. **Review all daily workflow files from the week**
2. **Identify patterns:**
   - What worked well?
   - What didn't work?
   - What systems need adjustment?
3. **Update automation rules** based on learnings
4. **Adjust delegation thresholds** if needed
5. **Plan improvements for next week**

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjust Questions

Edit the templates to add/remove questions based on your needs:
- Add project-specific questions
- Add industry-specific metrics
- Add personal productivity preferences

### Adjust Metrics

Modify the tracking metrics in `DAILY-WORKFLOW-TEMPLATE.md`:
- Add custom metrics
- Change thresholds
- Add new categories

### Adjust Frequency

- **Daily workflow:** Can be done weekly if daily is too much
- **Chat template:** Can be simplified for quick sessions
- **Audit:** Can be bi-weekly or monthly if weekly is too frequent

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Skipping the Pre-Work
- **Problem:** Jumping into work without answering questions
- **Solution:** Make it a non-negotiable habit. No work until questions answered.

### ❌ Not Identifying ONE Domino
- **Problem:** Working on multiple priorities simultaneously
- **Solution:** Force yourself to choose ONE. Everything else can wait.

### ❌ Ignoring Energy Levels
- **Problem:** Working when energy is low, wasting time
- **Solution:** Match work complexity to energy level. Rest when needed.

### ❌ Not Tracking Metrics
- **Problem:** Can't improve what you don't measure
- **Solution:** Spend 2 minutes at end of day filling metrics.

### ❌ Skipping Weekly Audits
- **Problem:** Systems degrade over time
- **Solution:** Schedule audit time. Treat it like a meeting.
