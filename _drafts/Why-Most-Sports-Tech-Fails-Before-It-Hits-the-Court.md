> Sports tech doesn’t fail because of bad tech. It fails because no one owns the workflow, value isn’t explicit, and the alignment isn’t there.

## The operator’s view

- Pilots that never scale: missing owner, unclear “job to be done,” no time back  
- “Innovation theater” vs the boring work that changes Tuesday

## CLEAR thinking to prevent waste

- Constraints: what cannot change?  
- Levers: what 1–2 inputs actually move the metric?  
- Evidence: what counts as proof?  
- Alignment: who wins, who loses, who decides?  
- Rhythm: how often does the loop run and reset?

## What survives first contact

- A single workflow shaved by 50%+  
- Metrics tied to dollars, wins, or time  
- One screen that operators live in, not ten features

If you’re scoping a pilot, I can help set constraints, define owners, and measure real value. [Contact](/contact)
