## Story Structure (3 Acts - MANDATORY)

### Act I: Setup and Problem (~400-500 words)

**Basketball Situation:**
- Start with basketball action (dribble situation)
- Introduce the crew in basketball context
- Show the basketball challenge/problem
- Hint at AI/math/coding concepts but don't explain yet

**Writing Prompts:**
- What basketball situation starts the story?
- What dribble move is the team struggling with?
- What's the basketball problem they need to solve?
- How does the dribble level connect to the challenge?

**Your Writing Space:**
```
[Write Act I here - 400-500 words]
[Start with basketball action, not concept explanation]
[Use basketball terminology naturally]
[Make it engaging and adventurous]
```

---

### Act II: Learning and Struggle (~400-500 words)

**Concept Emergence:**
- Basketball challenge intensifies
- Characters realize they need help (AI, math, coding)
- Concepts emerge naturally from basketball needs
- Characters learn to use concepts to solve basketball problems
- Struggle makes the solution meaningful

**Writing Prompts:**
- How does the dribble challenge get harder?
- What AI/math/coding concept emerges from the basketball need?
- How do characters learn to use the concept?
- What makes the struggle meaningful?

**Your Writing Space:**
```
[Write Act II here - 400-500 words]
[Show concepts emerging FROM basketball needs]
[Don't explain concepts before basketball context]
[Make the struggle real and engaging]
```

---

### Act III: Resolution and Application (~400-500 words)

**Basketball Success:**
- Characters apply what they learned to win the basketball challenge
- Basketball success demonstrates mastery of AI/math/coding concepts
- Students see the connection: "This is how AI/math/coding helps in basketball"
- Climax challenge completed successfully

**Writing Prompts:**
- How do characters apply the concept to solve the dribble challenge?
- What basketball success demonstrates mastery?
- How is the connection made clear?
- What's the climax moment?

**Your Writing Space:**
```
[Write Act III here - 400-500 words]
[Make basketball success the proof of learning]
[Show practical application immediately]
[End with satisfying resolution]
```
