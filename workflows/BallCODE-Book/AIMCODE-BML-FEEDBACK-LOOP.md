# AIMCODE Build-Measure-Learn Feedback Loop
## Continuous Improvement System for BallCODE Development

**PROJECT IDENTIFIER:** `BALLCODE-BOOK-AIMCODE-BML-v1.0`  
**Purpose:** Systematic feedback loop integrating AIMCODE methodology with story creation, game development, and continuous improvement  
**Last Updated:** December 2025

---

## Overview

The AIMCODE Build-Measure-Learn (BML) feedback loop creates a continuous improvement system where:
1. **BUILD**: Stories and game features are created using AIMCODE methodology
2. **MEASURE**: Metrics are collected automatically to track effectiveness
3. **LEARN**: Data is analyzed to refine both the product and the methodology
4. **Repeat**: Improved methodology guides better stories and features

## Weekly BML Cycle

### Monday: BUILD Phase (Story/Game Feature Development)

**Morning: CLEAR Framework**
- **Clarity**: What are we building? What are the objectives?
- **Logic**: How does this build systematically on previous work?
- **Examples**: What examples/case studies inform this?
- **Adaptation**: What constraints exist? What flexibility needed?
- **Results**: How will we measure success?

**Afternoon: Alpha Evolve (Hassabis)**
- Identify foundational concepts (layer 1)
- Build systematically on previous layers
- Ensure mastery before moving forward
- Connect concepts to form integrated systems

**End of Day: Research & Experts**
- Research: Tier 2 (15 min) - Educational research
- Experts: Apply AIMCODE advisory board principles
- Document hypothesis: What do we expect to learn?

**Deliverables:**
- Story/game feature created
- AIMCODE validation completed
- Hypothesis documented
- Metrics hooks in place

---

### Tuesday-Wednesday: Continue BUILD

**Continue development:**
- Complete story/game feature
