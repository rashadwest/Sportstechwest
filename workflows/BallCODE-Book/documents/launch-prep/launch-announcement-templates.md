I'm excited to announce the launch of BallCODE - a program that teaches coding, math, and AI concepts through basketball.

After seeing how hard it is to engage students in STEM subjects, I created BallCODE to combine the excitement of basketball with hands-on learning.

What makes BallCODE different:
• Story-first approach - students read basketball stories that teach coding
• Interactive exercises - 60-90 second game challenges reinforce concepts
• Complete learning loop - read, practice, understand
• Designed for grades 3-8
• No special equipment needed

We're offering free pilot programs to select schools. If you know educators who might be interested, I'd love to connect.
